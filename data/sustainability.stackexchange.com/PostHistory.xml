Ideally, LCA's provide a quantitative and clear answer, but that's rarely true - they are quantitative though, which is really important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some of your later questions, particularly around batteries, the answers will depend on the study. The technical terms here are allocation and boundary conditions. Do we model battery recycling? who gets the benefits of it? what technologies are we looking at, and what other products do those produce? What impacts or processes do we include or exclude? There are generally a lot of assumptions, which need to be made and defended to move forward - though often they need to be revised for new technology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer your initial question, older Priuses had an LCA done showing that they were 'worse' than a Hummer in terms of carbon footprint. Newer ones are significantly better, and keeping the car longer will definitely decrease the relative impact (one of the assumptions is about how long cars last). Check out a newer study [here][4]. In terms of toxicity, here's an [older][5] and [newer][6] study on the topic - it can take some study to get a reasonable answer, and it's rarely clear-cut. There are almost always tradeoffs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.lcia-recipe.net/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702178s&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8885172735616357524&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,39&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es103607c" />

And debt / savings can be eliminated at the push of a button too - that's what debt cancellation is. And both of these things are happening around us right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interest is a real price, in a real market&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, interest represents a **real** price - the price of credit. If you've got a sum of money that you can access now, you can choose to spend it now, or you can choose to spend it later. If you've got the same sum of money, but you can only access it in one year's time, then you can spend it any time after 1 year, but at no point between now and then. So, by definition, that money that is locked away for a year is worth less than money available now, because you can do less with it. And the price of that is what interest represents - the price of credit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Credit has a real price, and to hide that real price, would distort the market for credit, creating long-term distortions, and actually worsening economic efficiency and thus economic sustainability. Now, economic sustainability is by no means the only kind - there's social sustainability, resource sustainability, and so on. And they are all important. " />

Modification is still possible, many pedestal sinks do not actually require the pedestal, and can be mounted directly to the wall. This could allow mounting over a toilet if desired, though the options will vary depending on the specific fixtures used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the proceeding example, I will assume that you are working with a system that you have complete control of, and authority over, such as a single family home. You may be able to discuss these options with the community, if you live in an apartment or similar system, as implementation would require group approval, but the benefits would still apply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You would want to start by changing the drainage path from any grey drains, sinks/tubs/washing machine for example, to drain into a holding cistern, rather than into the septic/sewage system. You could divert downspouts from your rain gutters to deposit into the grey water cistern as well. While a single bathroom sink may not have enough overall drainage to supply a single toilet with adequate quantities of water, the grey cistern will have a much greater chance of meeting the demand. This will leave you with only black water drains entering the septic/sewage system, thereby providing use of the same water twice before discarding, and as such greatly reducing your water usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may (should?) be able to collect more in the grey water cistern than is needed to provide a supply for your toilet needs. This cistern may also be tapped for other uses such as watering the lawn and garden, washing the vehicles or building exterior, and so on. Grey water could ferment, if left in the cistern too long, so a drainage option should be included as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest finding reading specifically relating to grey water systems before implementing a project, to better familiarize yourself with the setup, as well as potential hazards. Jay Bazuzi recommended Art Ludwig's *Create an Oasis with Greywater*, and from the description it appears to be a good place to start. There are many books on the topic, and the more you read the better you will be prepared. You might also be interested in researching 'Humanure' while you are at it, as a way to recycle the black water drains as well, providing a possible third use of the same water; as well as increasing food production, and further reducing septic/sewage load.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some other things to consider are the possible impact of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Fecal matter reaching the grey water, e.g. cloth diapers in the washing machine.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Urine reaching the grey water, e.g. urinating in the shower.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Cleaning products in the grey water, and their affect on plant life, if using to water the lawn/garden." />

But the actual calculation of such values is very complex and always comes along with a lot of research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mentioned the example of trains (Deutsche Bahn). Let's dig into it. What do we need to know for an objective estimation of your ecological impact?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Model and size of train (ICE, IC, EC, RE, RB, S-Bahn, Tram, ...)&#xD;&#xA; - Type of energy used (diesel, electricity, ...)&#xD;&#xA; - Quantity of energy used&#xD;&#xA; - Average speed, number of stops&#xD;&#xA; - Number of passengers (occupancy)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With these accurate numbers you could calculate your ecological impact (*carbon footprint*) for traveling by train. I doubt that the *Deutsche Bahn* for instance is able to provide you with all these data. And even if they could it's getting more complex. For example - if a train uses electricity - how do you know how the electricity was produced? It's a huge difference on the ecological impact if the train is powered by coal power plants or by renewable energy sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All you get is always some vague estimations. Let's have a look at flights. This is a very hot topic and a lot of sites on the internet offer some sort of calculators.

This one allows you to adjust more parameters, for example type of plane and overall occupance of the plane. Maybe a better resource. But still no full *obective* resource to estimate your travel impacts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, I hope this is enough to answer your question and explained why I said &quot;No&quot; in the beginning.

At first thought, the snow is cold so how could it keep one warm. The true value is in the insulation. The design creates a small insulating shelter. The cold weather stays out, the body heat stays in. This is part of the reason they are built small, like tents. The small volume is easier to heat by residual body temperature alone. The more people in the structure, the quicker and warmer it will become.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The human body averages 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the reason for hypothermia is the environment is sapping too much of that heat energy away from the body. By creating an igloo or similar structure, it is possible to prevent the body heat from moving too far away. As the body releases heat energy, it becomes trapped in the igloo by the thick snow walls, and builds up. The interior will not reach 98.6, but it is possible to raise it to a much more comfortable temperature than the frigid outside air.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing to remember with igloos is that they are cut down into the snow pack, *not* built on top of it. This allows a smaller surface area presented to the outer environment. Also, the orientation of the door must be taken into consideration. Allowing the cold wind to drive right in through the door is not a good idea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, the snow itself will still be cold to the touch. Proper clothing is essential, the igloo just helps to maintain an environment with a higher ambient air temperature, thereby slowing the rate of heat loss from the human body. Any structure performs the same function, the igloo works with body heat because of its small size compared to the size of the occupants. Obviously, if the igloo is built too large for the number of occupants, it will not be possible to heat with residual heat alone." />

This is not a problem per se if new ways to acquire and exploit new resources are invented. But what is dangerous is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;a) too fast growth of consumption&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;b) lack of reserves&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;c) lack of flexibility&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In history, there were good times, when consumption grew, and bad times, when cultures unable to change their habits collapsed. Some civilisations, like ancient Egypt or China, were able to recover from the hard times easier than others, who didn't survive crises so well or even at all. Why?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems to be closely connected with the basic orientation of the culture. For example in ancient Egypt, the biggest goal was to &quot;live forever&quot; - their growth aimed to produce tomb treasures, which could be looted and reused in bad times. There are theories that people could legally loot their ancestors' tombs if the ancestors didn't bless them and protect them - the dead (and especially dead kings) were believed to have power to ensure blessing of good crops and of freedom from enemies. Whether these theories are true or not is a question for History.SE, the conclusion is that such civilisation was oriented for long term survival, not for temporary growth and that it survived thousands of years, at least three big crises and many smaller ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there were many cultures even more oriented for growth than our civilisation - they were mostly war-like states, like most of Dark Age kingdoms. Constant war, winning, loot and new vassals were requirements of their existence, so few such states survived, and many ceased to exist in few years, with just few major defeats. The culture survived the end of such states, but it couldn't stay long in with such orientation on military expansion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our civilisation is more similar to the Dark Age than to ancient Egypt, but of course better - it's oriented on economic and technological growth, which are more resistant to temporary failures than military expansion. But not so much - recent economic crisis shows it's drawback. And there are ecological challenges, oil peak and so on. Existence of this forum shows that there are people who try to make the civilisation sustainable, but the idea that we don't need reserves, because technological growth will solve everything decreases flexibility of our civilisation. How shall we survive the moment of opening eyes and seeing that oil is too rare to be cheap, and that other sources are too expensive for our [potlatch][1]?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, economic growth can be sustainable, but &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;a) must be slower&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;b) must be backed up by better reserves for bad times&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;c) must not be a basic aim of the civilisation, since orientation to growth is in conflict with flexibility and willingness to decrease my consumption for the good of the whole. This is a matter of values - if most people are egoists who would rather accept risk of collapse of civilisation later than to decrease standard of living now, than growth is not sustainable and will eventually lead to disaster, but with certain minimal percentage of altruists willing to decrease their ecological footprint, even groth can be sustainable.

They may be left out in bright sunshine all day in which case they will likely generate more energy than was used to manufacture them over their lifespan, or they may stay locked in a cupboard on all but a couple of days a year. Their efficiency will depend much more on the construction technique and technology used as well, so it's hard to give a certain objective answer here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the advantage with these panels is less about the energy you can make back, and much more about the convenience of harvesting power without batteries in the wilderness, or trickle charging without having to change rechargeable batteries. Up to a certain point, yes you may well be better using rechargeable batteries - but what happens after that? If I'm on a journey through wilderness for a few weeks in a hot climate, does it make more sense to take a few ten's of AAs with me, or a simple solar panel and a bunch of connectors?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These sorts of panels may well not make their energy consumption back over the course of their lifetime, but you could postulate a sensible argument that that's not their aim.

It's then a relatively straightforward comparison.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But with devices that don't produce energy, only consume it, this is much less clear cut. What even counts as breaking even? Doing a certain amount of work, making a certain amount of calculations? Being in service for a certain amount of years? The degree to which the containing components can be recycled? Since they don't produce energy, no such device will ever break even in a simple, single unit sense of the word.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe this is the reason why there is no commonly accepted &quot;minimum time&quot; that you should own and use a device before disposing of it, and the challenges we face most in this regard are much more along the lines of how to properly recycle and manage this level of waste that we just didn't have 15 years ago, rather than how to work out if we've somehow &quot;broken even&quot; on the energy used to produce the device, and can now morally move on." />

You can find tomatoes starting on p156. The info below is cribbed from this book and other sources. (Note that saving tomato seeds is a bit more involved than many other vegetables, some of which are trivial to save, like peas or beans.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are trying to save your own seeds indefinitely (i.e. without refreshing from another source), you'd want to save seeds from at least 20 different plants of the same variety.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With modern varieties, you may not have to worry about isolation because they don't tend to cross. If you want to be sure about avoiding crossing, you can cage them to avoid insect crossing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tomato seeds need to ferment before they are viable. You'll need to help this fermentation along. Squeeze the seeds and tomato &quot;goo&quot; into a small bucket -- a 32oz yogurt container, deli tub, or similar container. Be sure to label the tubs. After a few days it will smell bad and grow a layer of mold over the top. (You'll want to have the bucket in a place where it won't get tipped over...) At this point, add more water, swish it around, and then let it settle for a moment. The good seeds will be at the bottom. You can skim off the top, or just pour the whole mess through a fine strainer. Rinse. &quot;Seed to Seed&quot; suggests putting the good seeds on a paper coffee filter; cloth or paper towels are a bad idea because it will be really hard to remove the seeds when they are dry. Let the seeds air-dry in dark place, stirring regularly. If they stay damp they may start to germinate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also [this answer in gardening.SE about saving seeds](http://gardening.stackexchange.com/a/774/51) in general; that answer has a link to info that is specific to tomatoes." />

A sustainable system is closed in the sense that you need to buy as little resources as possible and produce as little waste as possible. Your system just keeps turning, like a perpetual motion machine, with you feeding off the system. Composting your waste is a way to reintroduce it into your system and &quot;closing the loop&quot; so to speak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your case you are not part of a self-sufficient sustainable system. All you can do to live more sustainably is take measures to have as little negative impact on the system as you can, that is reduce the number of things you need to buy and reduce your waste (or give out your waste in a way for the system to make it reusable, which you do by separating your trash). A direct way to control your impact on the system is to&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Reduce your requirements for input and reduce your wasteful output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, there are many people who use their balcony as garden, be that just herbs, vegetables (like runner beans on poles, potatoes) or bees. To overcome the climate conditions, you could consider turning your balcony into a greenhouse by adding a layer of glass, which would reduce your input (gas/electricity for your heating) and reduce your wasteful output (CO2 emitted for generating the heat). Again, a balcony vegetable garden would reduce input (groceries, plastic bags) and wasteful output (plastic bags, CO2 emissions from the supermarket trucks, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Composting makes most sense when you use the compost yourself, but even if you do not use it yourself, your gardening neighbour would probably be happy to receive good compost, or even just good food waste. This way you make sure that your food waste doesn't just get burned, which would be a real shame. Food waste is so close to being something so useful...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Compost is useful where something grows, be that lush foliage, or just shrubs. In your climate, it is admittedly not easy to live sustainably, because you need or want things which your environment does not provide." />

However unlike the fecal-oral transmission cycle, I think the risk of this getting spread back via food is pretty low.   Also I treat this as theoretical because all kinds of other stuff we compost (read:  anything that you'd want to refridgerate if saving to eat again!) could also grow bacteria that are pathogenic to humans...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are just concerns.  Like all concerns they mean that you can plan for them and overcome them with a little bit of effort.  Keep it enclosed to ensure critters can't access.  Add low-carbon material to compensate (straw might be good), and accept that the bones are going to still be in large pieces when youa are done.  Adding meat to the compost pile adds maintenance.

The fact is that cultures, languages, and economies are constantly changing.  Because an economy is always changing we have to be careful regarding definitions of sustainable.

The question is what is required to get there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Prof. Joseph Tainter points out in his books and lectures, very often times, immediate sustainability sacrifices long-term sustainability because it requires additional complexity and consumption.

Scientific head behind this project seems to be [Prof.dr.ir. Arjen Y. Hoekstra][4] at the University of Twente. In his book *The water footprint assessment manual: Setting the global standard* ([PDF, pages 48-51][5]), he writes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In order to calculate the water footprint of the final product in a production&#xD;&#xA;system, one can best start calculating the water footprints of the most original&#xD;&#xA;resources (where the supply chain starts) and then calculate, step-by-step,&#xD;&#xA;the water footprints of the intermediate products, until one can calculate the&#xD;&#xA;water footprint of the final product.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's four pages worth a read if you want to find out more about water footprints of consumer products. Hoekstra explains two different approaches of how to calculate the footprints.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the essence is: **You need data**. For you cellphone you need to find out:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - all details on processes of the production&#xD;&#xA; - all data of contained parts of the cellphone&#xD;&#xA; - all energy and ressources used&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;... and maybe much more. To be honest, I doubt you will be able to research this on your own and cellphone producers wont give out such data to consumers unless they really have some kind of transparency drive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To find out the exact amount of virtual water used in your cellphone you will have to start your own dedicated research project which will only work *in coorperation* with the manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/91/103&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/93/103&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.waterfootprint.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.utwente.nl/ctw/wem/organisatie/medewerkers/hoekstra/arjen_hoekstra.doc/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.waterfootprint.org/downloads/TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual.pdf" />

A mother is not genetically identical to the daughter it produces, and every mother is not identical to all other mothers. The organisms in your scoby (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) affect how the fermented tea will taste, so you will always have variety. They also adapt, so if you are using a specific kind of tea for a long time, the daughters produced will start to adapt to the environment and perhaps be better tasting, or maybe not. If you really like the way your friend's tea tastes, you should get a daughter from them and if you like how the tea you make tastes, you should always keep the mother and give away the daughters or compost them or keep them as back up, whatever you choose.  Also, websites/forums that you only have to pay for postage will allow you to get more than 1 or get another easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people, and I appreciate this isn't a mainstream thought, are of the opinion that you shouldn't ever buy a mother or something like Keifer grains because the organisms are so prolific that its offensive the the energy of the organism to get money for something it obviously wants to share.

You just need a way to gently circulate it past the stove and store it in a tank somewhere (one that can handle the temperature increasing somewhat higher than your average water tank!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your tank is located outside of the space you want to heat, you'll need to insulate it heavily, along with the pipes leading to it. In that case you may also need panels for radiating the heat back into the building, which you'd circulate the hot water through.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using a liquid to distribute heat is a common method of heating a building; sometimes oil is used and a furnace is running while the building needs heating though. Using oil almost certainly isn't going to be sustainable though, especially when you want to store a tank of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using water, all parts of the system will need to be protected from corrosion (from the inside, especially). It will also need to be able to handle the changes in pressure as the water warms up (and a sudden increase if the water happened to boil by overheating).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other than that, adding mass to any other part of your building that is reasonably warm will help, especially if the insulation is good. This may be an option too. It doesn't have to be right next to the stove (though the closer it is, the more effective it will be)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/80/15&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity" />

The common way of doing that is to put your food in the freezer, although I have also seen people preserve grain in barrels filled with nitrogen. (Canning is another option. You just have to be sure, there are no moulds or bacteria inside. People have died from improperly canned food.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other would be to change the food into something that you can still eat, but bugs, moulds, etc. cannot eat any longer. Here you are making use of two advantages which you have over your competitors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. You are the larger organism. That is to say, you can digest food that smaller organisms cannot digest any longer. I am a big fan of honey, for example. Why do you think that honey doesn't get mouldy? Because it is rich in minerals, vitamins and other things that moulds, or probably even ants can't digest. (Bears can, however.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. You have the power of reversing the preservation process, at least to some extent. E.g. you can reconstitute dried food. You don't have to eat it in the preserved state. Your competitors do, however.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using these two advantages, you can change fresh food into something that, at least for the period of preservation, is not edible by your competitors, but edible by you, once you choose to eat it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The true art of preserving food is, however, not to overdo it (because it will not taste as good) and not &quot;underdo&quot; it (or your competitors, the bugs, moulds, etc. will eat it first). You need to get it &quot;just right&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, when preparing preserved food, you should ask yourself for what period you would like to preserve it and under which conditions you will store it (humidity and temperature are the biggest factors). Then taking into account discrepancies in your calculation, you preserve your food.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Salting is very good and doesn't vary so much with humidity. It rather varies with length of preservation and temperature of storage place. A cool place slows down the process of your food being &quot;eaten&quot; by someone else. For Japanese pickled plums (umeboshi) I have the figures in my head:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 7% salt: 1 year in the fridge&#xD;&#xA;- 12-15% salt: 1 year at room temperature (up to 30, 35 degrees in the summer)&#xD;&#xA;- 20%+ salt: indefinitely at room temperature (7 year umeboshi are quite a delicacy)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The plums are dried in the sun for several days, several hours per day before salting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I presume similar measures apply to meat. These plums are extremely salty though. You can't really take more than 1 small plum per meal. If you decide to dry and salt your meat, you have to decide how you want to eat it in the end. A big salt-preserved steak won't taste very good...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similar ideas apply to smoking and drying. Be sure how you want to eat your preserved meat, for how long you want (or need) to preserve it and then by frugal with your preservation methods. Frugal, but not too frugal." />

Or make arrangements so that a larger animal (e.g. in the case where you're keeping dairy animals like goats or cattle) can be shared among enough people so that the meat is used immediately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Canning&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's energy intensive up-front, but meat can be home canned and preserved for extended periods of time (possibly longer than salting, smoking, or drying).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Canning meat requires a bit of investment in equipment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* pressure canner (~$80)&#xD;&#xA;* jars, lids, and rings (~$15 per dozen quart jar kit)&#xD;&#xA;* a few misc. tools (e.g. jar lifter)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the canner, jars, rings, and tools can be reused many times so that the cost per batch ends up very low.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can get detailed instructions for home canning meat in trusted books like the &quot;Ball Blue Book&quot; or from the US [National Center for Home Food Preservation](http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can5_meat.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the canning is done, all you have to do is keep the product in a relatively cool, dark, dry place." />

With respect to mulch in the summer, it would make sense to put the used bedding to service as mulch -- it will carry along a bit of extra nutrient enrichment. (Of course, being careful not to use it around crops that would come into contact with manures like spinach or lettuce.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My choices for bedding would include straw, wood shavings, sawdust, hay, and dry leaves -- depending on the needs of the animals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With any of these, if you are going to DIY, you can make a place to store the finished product until it is ready for use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Starting with the cheapest and possibly the easiest: dry leaves. You might be able to acquire a large quantity of leaves for free. Do you live in a place where people rake up the leaves on their lawns and leave them in bags at the curb? If so, round up a bunch of bags when they're in season and store them for use as bedding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Depending on where you live, you might be able to find wood byproducts from a mill for cheap or free -- you'd just have to find a way to transport them to your house. Unfortunately arborist wood chips, which can sometimes be had for free by asking a passing tree truck, are too coarse for animal bedding -- though they do make for nice mulch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could try growing your own straw. I believe you're in Australia's hardiness zone 4, so your winter lows are about 0°C? You could set aside a portion of your yard to growing a grain crop for straw. An appropriate choice might even be something you could grow as a cover crop during your mild winter. With some planning and luck maybe you could even get a triple yield and harvest some grain for use as animal feed or for your own use. (But at least save enough grain so that you have seed for the next crop!) The downside here is the amount of space required, the low straw yield you'll probably get, and the amount of manual labor required to process it. At your scale a scythe is a reasonable way to harvest the crop; I'm guessing that machinery isn't practical in your setting (e.g. hiring someone to come and process 700m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; seems very unlikely). The straw also won't be compacted like machine made bales, so it will take up more space in storage, and may be more prone to taking up moisture if you live in a humid climate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly you could try planting your yard to a hay crop. This has the benefit over straw of being perennial. It may be harder to process -- grass is wetter and will take longer to dry. It is also heavier to handle. I'm not a fan of hay for mulch since it is full of seeds and often carries weeds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't want to do it yourself, but want to avoid going to a store, ask around to find farmers in your area who may be willing to sell you what you need. You may be able to get it cheaper or more conveniently if you have the storage at your house to buy a bulk amount.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can usually save money if you pick up the hay &quot;out of the field&quot; instead of after the farmer has done the work of transporting it and stacking it in his barn. This takes some coordination with the farmer so that you know exactly when the hay is being harvested, and being flexible with your schedule to go and pick it up immediately. (I do this, and it sometimes requires clearing my schedule for an afternoon so that I can go pick up hay and stack it in my barn.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a final note: you will probably end up wanting to combine some of these. E.g. build a storage shed, get dry leaves off your neighbors' curbs when you can, plant a stand of buff oats for straw and as a cover crop, and find someone nearby who can supply you with enough hay to fill those months where you have gaps in your homegrown supply." />

If you overdo it, I suppose your plants won't grow and that will be a warning sign.....&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Moving the existing compost pile once a year or so and growing plants where the old one was.

They'll skip the stuff they don't like (e.g. banana peels), and you can rake this up when they're done to use for composting. (If you watch [Back to Eden](http://backtoedenfilm.com/), there's a short segment about this practice. It's only a short bit of the film, but the rest of it is worth watching anyway.) Other animals will eat scraps like this too -- pigs, for example. (But do know your animals and avoid feeding anything that would be harmful!)&#xD;&#xA;* If you're getting resistance to simply managing a &quot;proper&quot; compost pile, you could switch to low-management forms of composting like trench composting. With this, you just dig a trench maybe 45-60cm deep and as long as appropriate. Fill the trench with your organic waste, starting at one end. When a section of the trench is filled to within 5-10cm of the top of the hole, cover with topsoil. Over time the waste will decompose and the trench will sink a bit -- you can  dig another trench next to it and use the soil from the second trench to level out the first one.&#xD;&#xA;* [Biogas digester](http://www.green-trust.org/methane.htm), though this requires some up-front investment and some acquired skill in managing the equipment and handling the gas.

It's not that it can't be done, you have to be used to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of removing the washing machine from your lives, it would be advisable to use it in a more efficient manner.

Can it be worn again before a wash?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And be more efficient in your usage - fill the machine to capacity before use, use shorter cycles - specially if there isn't much cleaning to do, just sweat and BO to clean. And the biggest saving you could make is by sun drying clothes instead of using a electric dryer. If the clothes aren't dripping, and have been wringed, it shouldn't take too long for them to dry in the sun, or in the air if isn't sunny(if it's not raining, or too cold, it'll take a few hours). The spin cycle of your washing machine should wring the clothes well enough.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember, sustainable living doesn't mean we forsake the comforts of modern life - just that we use them efficiently and judiciously." />

A high **latent heat of fusion** means that a lot of energy is needed for each kg of material, in order to turn it from solid to liquid.

In aquaculture, effluents accumulate in the water, increasing toxicity for the fish. This water is led to a hydroponic system where the by-products from the aquaculture are filtered out by the plants as vital nutrients, after which the cleansed water is recirculated back to the animals. The term aquaponics is a portmanteau of the terms aquaculture and hydroponic.&#xD;&#xA;Aquaponic systems vary in size from small indoor or outdoor units to large commercial units, using the same technology. The systems usually contain fresh water, but salt water systems are plausible depending on the type of aquatic animal and which plants.[citation needed] Aquaponic science may still be considered to be at an early stage, relative to other sciences." />

Fun and 100% post-consumer recycled ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Mulching.  I am not a fan of just throwing paper in the compost heap unless you are trying to shift the C-N balance towards C (treat paper as &quot;brown&quot;) but it can make a very good lower level for sheet mulching.  See &quot;Gaia's Garden&quot; for more information on this technique of soil building.  Here the purpose of the paper would be as much to act as a temporary mulching barrier as it would be to feed into the compost." />

In general, server farms are going to be a more efficient use of electricity than everyone hosting a site locally (even if that were technically feasible). And, for context, while server farms consume a [lot of electricity][1] on an absolute basis, the whole internet uses about [2% of the nationwide total][2], a very good deal considering the services provided (and clearly room to improve). Having pages hosted at home would require a lot of personal computers to be on all the time, rather than shared servers. So, assuming we want to have a digitally connected civilization, server farms are probably a good choice to get economies of scale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To the second question: Primarily, what you want to look for is where they get their electricity, ideally whether they pay attention to energy efficiency, and, if possible, whether they are decent to their employees. There are several companies out there that buy renewable energy directly, or buy renewable energy credits ([RECs][3]) equal to or greater than their demand. It's probably preferable to go with one that buys direct, but either way will help incentivize more green power. Statements of corporate responsibility - sponsorship, values, etc. - might help with the other metrics. As with anything, there are a lot of different impacts that could be considered, but since electricity is responsible for the bulk of the global warming impacts from the internet (as well as some respiratory-related ones), that's a straightforward decision tool.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4937762&amp;url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4937762&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/rec.htm" />

One, two or all three might be significant in any particular case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **convection** - the movement of hot air to a colder place, and the movement of cold air to a hotter place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **radiation** - the transfer of heat through electromagnetic radiation, such as the sun shining in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **conduction** - the passage of heat through a material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thermal mass&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thermal mass, or thermal inertia, represents a heat store. It is, in the broadest sense, the sum of mass x specific heat of everything in the house.  Air has a very low thermal mass; concrete, bricks, plaster, have much higher thermal masses. If you use internal wall insulation, your rooms will have lower thermal mass. If you use external wall insulation, your rooms will have higher thermal mass. Higher thermal mass means more temperature stability - you have to move a lot more energy to change their temperature by a given number of degrees Celsius.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where cold and overheating is coming from&#xD;&#xA;--- &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Buildings that are too cold, are typically losing a lot of heat through convection and conduction.  To fix this, insulation should increase air-tightness, to reduce convection, and should add thermal resistance, reducing conduction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Buildings that are too hot, are typically gaining a lot of heat through direct solar radiation. In this case, preventing sunlight coming into the building at all is the first priority; next, prevent sunlight falling on walls that are directly connected to the inside of the property, and get as much air through the property as possible, when temperatures drop at night - this is also called night purge ventilation" />

Compost is a key ingredient in organic farming. At the simplest level, the process of composting simply requires making a heap of wetted organic matter (leaves, &quot;green&quot; food waste) and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of weeks or months. Modern, methodical composting is a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture. Worms and fungi further break up the material. Aerobic bacteria manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium. The ammonium is further converted by bacteria into plant-nourishing nitrites and nitrates through the process of nitrification." />

At first thought, the snow is cold so how could it keep one warm. The true value is in the insulation. The design creates a small insulating shelter. The cold weather stays out, the body heat stays in. This is part of the reason they are built small, like tents. The small volume is easier to heat by residual body temperature alone. The more people in the structure, the quicker and warmer it will become.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The human body averages 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37°C), the reason for hypothermia is the environment is sapping too much of that heat energy away from the body. By creating an igloo or similar structure, it is possible to prevent the body heat from moving too far away. As the body releases heat energy, it becomes trapped in the igloo by the thick snow walls, and builds up. The interior will not reach 98.6, but it is possible to raise it to a much more comfortable temperature than the frigid outside air.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing to remember with igloos is that they are cut down into the snow pack, *not* built on top of it. This allows a smaller surface area presented to the outer environment. Also, the orientation of the door must be taken into consideration. Allowing the cold wind to drive right in through the door is not a good idea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, the snow itself will still be cold to the touch. Proper clothing is essential, the igloo just helps to maintain an environment with a higher ambient air temperature, thereby slowing the rate of heat loss from the human body. Any structure performs the same function, the igloo works with body heat because of its small size compared to the size of the occupants. Obviously, if the igloo is built too large for the number of occupants, it will not be possible to heat with residual heat alone." />

The chimney is insulated and gets very hot, which helps burn more of the gases of combustion, producing more heat from the same fuel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cooking pot sits directly over the chimney, so the hot exhaust hits it directly. You can also add a skirt around the pot, so the exhaust gas is held close to the sides of the pot, further improving heat transfer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To create a functioning rocket stove, you need an insulated J-shaped chimney. Like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![][1]][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can add a second 90-degree bend to make the whole thing U-shaped, but the chimney must be much longer than the fuel end, so it will draw the exhaust in the right direction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You asked about principles, and one is that the bend to the chimney should be sharp, not a gentle curve. This will create turbulence that will mix the gases and air for better combustion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have to get the chimney hot to make it work. One way is to light the fire *in the chimney*, then start adding fuel the regular way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use just about any found materials that can tolerate the heat and provide insulation where needed.

I totally agree with @Laizer that they are quite resilient and it is obvious if a scoby is healthy or not. Black is bad, mold is bad, lack of effervescence is bad.

I always keep a backup in starter tea in a small jar in my fridge just in case something happens to the ones I'm using.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The nice thing about getting it from a friend is you can tell how your tea will taste and choose accordingly. Kombucha, unlike something like Keifer, does not clone itself every time it grows. A mother is not genetically identical to the daughter it produces, and every mother is not identical to all other mothers. The organisms in your scoby (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) affect how the fermented tea will taste, so you will always have variety. They also adapt, so if you are using a specific kind of tea for a long time, the daughters produced will start to adapt to the environment and perhaps be better tasting, or maybe not. If you really like the way your friend's tea tastes, you should get a daughter from them and if you like how the tea you make tastes, you should always keep the mother and give away the daughters or compost them or keep them as back up, whatever you choose.  Also, websites/forums that you only have to pay for postage will allow you to get more than 1 or get another easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people, and I appreciate this isn't a mainstream thought, are of the opinion that you shouldn't ever buy a mother or something like Keifer grains because the organisms are so prolific that its offensive the the energy of the organism to get money for something it obviously wants to share.

It's not a federal program like the Do Not Call Registry but most reputable direct marketers belong to the DMA, and they offer an opt-out service to you, the consumer. You fill out a form with the DMA, then they compile a list of those who do not wish to receive unsolicited mail and send it to client companies who order these lists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are three ways to register with the DMA's opt-out service: you can simply send a post card with your name and address to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mail Preference Service&#xD;&#xA;Direct Marketing Association&#xD;&#xA;PO Box 643&#xD;&#xA;Carmel, NY 10512&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your name will be added to the list. However this can take about a month to process with the DMA, as well as time for it to feed out to their client organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also a form provided on their web site that you can fill out and mail in to the same address as above. Filling out the form online gives it a unique tracking number that enables them to process the request faster than if you just send in a post card.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly you can fill out the online form and submit it online. This processes your application immediately and should result in the flow of junk mail slowing within a period of about 1 month.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to find out more about the DMA's Mail Preference Service check out their web site at http://www.dmaconsumers.org&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Opt-out of Junk Mail With Individual Companies**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not every company works in conjunction with the DMA's Mail Preference Service that allows for mass opt-out. However, many companies do provide forms to fill out so that you don't appear in the lists for their junk mail or to have your address distributed by them. Even if they don't have forms or a proper method in place you can still contact them either through their web site, snail mail or calling customer service and get something sorted out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the idea that we, the consumer, should have to go the extra mile in order to ensure that our names and addresses are not sold from here to Timbuktu and that we not receive unsolicited mail is ridiculous, but unfortunately it is also a fact of life. At least until tougher laws are passed and tighter regulations enforced on the direct marketing industry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The place to start individual opting out are businesses that you are in regular contact with. Your bank is a prime target. Also anytime a store asks you for your name and address, ask them what they do with the information and what you need to do to make sure it is not used to send junk mail to your house. Opt-out before they even have a chance to opt you in involuntarily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is an example of what I am talking about: in the summer of 2005 I went to a major furniture chain to purchase a freezer. When I made the purchase, they wanted information such as my name and address. I asked them what they would be using the information for and reluctantly they told me it would be used to send solicitations from them to my house.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I told them I did not want any junk mail coming to my house. They said ok, and before I left I fill out a three page form saying that I wanted no unsolicited mail from them coming to my house. All well and good, or so I thought. Then, a couple of months later they sent me a flyer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I called them, quite upset. After all the trouble I had gone through to fill out the forms so I would get no mail, I still got it in my mailbox. After some arguing with the manager I got him to take my name off the list, and since then I have not received any junk mail from them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Opt-out Telephone Numbers and Addresses**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here now we will look at contact information for a few businesses that engage in direct marketing. One of the worst types of junk mail are the constant credit card applications coming every day. These junk mailings are for the most part the work of three companies: Experian, Trans Union and Equifax, the big three credit reporting companies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three companies are the ones responsible for compiling all of the data that goes into creating your credit score. They are also to blame for the majority of credit card applications sent to your house. If you want these to stop, there is one simple telephone number you can call:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1-888-5OPTOUT or 1-888-567-8688&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will stop you from receiving junk mail from any of the big three credit reporting companies and should also stop the majority of the credit card applications coming your way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below are the addresses of many of the worst culprits in sending junk mail. Write them and tell them that you wish to opt-out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Publishing Clearinghouse Sweepstakes&#xD;&#xA;101 Channel Dr&#xD;&#xA;Port Washington, NY 11050&#xD;&#xA;1-800-645-9242&#xD;&#xA;1-800-453-0272 (fax)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;American Business information inc.&#xD;&#xA;Attn: Product Quality&#xD;&#xA;PO Box 27347&#xD;&#xA;Omaha, NE 68127&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Donnelly Marketing, inc&#xD;&#xA;Attn: Data Base Operations&#xD;&#xA;PO Box 3502&#xD;&#xA;Ames, IA 50010-3502&#xD;&#xA;888-633-4402&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haines and Company, inc.&#xD;&#xA;Criss-Cross Directory&#xD;&#xA;Attn: Director of Data Processing&#xD;&#xA;8050 Freedom Ave&#xD;&#xA;NW Canton, OH 44720&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is just a few of the worst offenders.

This form is designed to stop explicit and pornographic material from being sent to your home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You pick up the form from the post office (you can also find it online) fill it out and can stop all mail from being delivered to you coming from a certain company. While this is generally supposed to refer only to explicit and pornographic materials, the onus is on you for determining what is explicit and pornographic. If there is a single company that is really bothering you this might be the way to go in getting it stopped in short order.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From &quot;[How to Opt-Out of Junk Mail Coming to Your House][1]&quot; by Allen Butler&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://voices.yahoo.com/how-opt-out-junk-mail-coming-house-39715.html?cat=17" />

In other words, ecosystems are steered towards productive uses by our standards rather subtly instead of using force of effort to the detriment of everything.  Ecosystems are co-evolved so let's try to be part of that coevolution.  So having reframed the question that way, here are some thoughts about utilizing what is there:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Many kinds of trees can be utilized as fodder.  If you watch your animals you can see what they like to eat and a pruning saw (and a pair of loppers) can be used to retrieve some extra food from a bit higher than your animals can reach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The animal manure can help recycle nutrients in the natural ecosystem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  The edges of the forests are likely to be the most productive in this way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some thoughts about hazards:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Many kinds of grazing animals will prevent new edible trees from becoming established.  It is probably a good idea to plan to protect some areas for new trees from time to time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Overgrazing may also damage undergrowth in undesirable ways.  Again the problem here is overgrazing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now some thoughts specifically about boreal forests:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are mostly conifer forests.  This means that to the extent animals can graze on trees, they will be pines, firs, and the like.  This is not out of the question but it may mean something for animal selection.&#xD;&#xA;" />

It's purpose is to both hold water and drain superfluous water. On our green roof the drainage mats were included in the package with the growing medium and plants. I'm not sure if you can buy it separately, but it looks something like [this](http://ecobrooklyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/drainage-mat.jpg).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can place a filter fleece on top of the drainage layer to prevent it from clogging. We did this on our roof, but I know several people who didn't and their roof seems to work just fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now you can add the growing medium and vegetation. Don't forget to place pebbles or stones along the edges of the roof to allow drainage and to make sure that the vegetation won't start growing to places it is not supposed to grow (see for example picture below)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![green roof on our shed][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/tW8B8.jpg" />

With this approach, much of the unused part of the plant can be recycled as treats/food for the rabbit.  This is also true for dandelions, clover, thistles, and many other weeds that tend to pop up in gardens.  You'll need to do research on this because rabbit digestive systems are sensitive and feeding them the wrong food can sometimes be fatal even if the food is not poisonous.  Avoid foods that are &quot;gassy&quot; foods like broccoli, as rabbits do not pass gas easily and this can be an uncomfortable, sometimes fatal condition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can create a worm farm with their droppings.  The worms will speed the composting of the droppings and provide a harvest-able and sustainable crop of earthworms as well as providing an excellent top-soil/fertilizer for your garden.  The droppings can also be applied directly to your garden as fertilizer as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rabbit food is relatively inexpensive and a small herd can reproduce and grow fast enough to supplement a good portion the meat needs of a small family.  It is important to choose the right breed for your climate.  Some rabbits do not tolerate heat well at all.  Most rabbits tolerate cold so long as their water does not freeze. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [American Rabbit Breeders Association(ARBA)][1] is a group dedicated to the promotion of domestic rabbit breeding in the US.

A vapor barrier can be as simple as a sheet of something like plastic or aluminum which water can not pass through.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for needing a vapor barrier is that when air passes through the insulation from the warm side to the cool side, it is cooling.  As the temperature drops through the insulation, same of the water vapor will condense causing the insulation to be wet.  Fiber glass insulation that is wet does not insulate as well as dry insulation as the water helps to conduct heat through the insulation.  To make matters worse, the wetness can then reach the cool wall and water condensation can now form on that wall leading it to rot due to bacteria growing in the now damp environment." />

I came to the conclusion that I wasn't really sure, but that the environmental pros and cons were nearly a wash.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, the EGR is mandated by U.S. emissions standards, with the purpose of reducing [NOx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx) emissions. Although I have read claims that this is likely a [misguided effort](http://tdiclub.com/TDIFAQ/TDiFAQ-5.html).  Also, the addition of an EGR also increases other emissions.  If my rusty memory serves, removing the EGR allows for more complete combustion, resulting in lower particulate emissions... And less restrictive airflow also improves engine performance slightly (by up to 2HP at high RPM for this engine, if memory serves).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And lastly, the removal of the EGR means I never have to clean the soot out of my intake manifolds again, which means fewer chemical cleaners, and less maintenance cost over the lifetime of my vehicle.  And no EGR means the EGR can't break and need to be replaced again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So all things considered, and legalities aside, is an EGR (specifically in a 2003 VW TDI engine) an environmental gain or loss?&#xD;&#xA;" />

Also, how much veggies you eat (I think that number assumes a completely vegetarian diet).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Either way, in order to heat enough space, your best bet is probably to use row covers of heavy transparent plastic over your normal garden, rather than using a green house.  Lay in a fall crop of cold tolerant plants, and then build the row covers over the top of them.  Row covers are comparatively cheap to build and maintain.  They don't have to be anything more than hoops made of small diameter pvc pipe or steel re-bar with transparent plastic over them.  If you're somewhere with heavy snow, re-bar is probably the better choice.  As is a heavy plastic.  If your winter is light, you can probably get away with the pvc and a lighter weight plastic.  You can bury the edges a little, or cover them with mulch and stones to prevent them from blowing away in the wind.  Again, take into consideration just how rough the weather is likely to get. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another alternative is to use cold frames, wooden boxes with glass tops generally facing south.  These are generally harder to get a lot of area with than row covers, but they are very cheap and quick to build and pretty effective.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a semi decent run down of the types of row covers: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/row-covers?page=0,0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's the info graphic that 2 acres number comes from:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Space to be completely self sufficient][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKDTp.jpg" />

NOx is associated with smog and acidification, particulates are related to respiratory health, and fuel efficiency is related to global warming (among other things like cost). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This problem would seem to be whether we value lower NOx emissions more than lower particulates and GHG emissions. If you don't live in a city, the answer might be that the NOx is less important because smog is less of an issue. If you do live in or commute to a city, it's more of a tradeoff, though with at least a [50% reduction in NOx][1], the 3% lower fuel economy and higher particulates (trapped by a filter which has production impacts, but we'll neglect those for the moment) probably make the EGR a better choice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could probably put some economic values on these various problems (particularly the non-climate-change ones), but the order of magnitude difference would suggest that the EGR is a good idea.

In theory, you could use a number of different models (e.g. the infographic in Daniel Bingham's answer, John Jeavon's &quot;How to Grow More Vegetables&quot;, [etc](http://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1433/51)). You'll get a wide variety of answers, and a lot depends on your specific circumstances -- and will likely vary widely for you from year to year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that a limiting factor may not be so much the *cold*, but the fact that the plants get fewer hours of sunlight in the winter as you move to higher latitudes, so they're not growing as much in the winter. Eliot Coleman talks about this in some of his books. One strategy you can use if this is an issue is to start your plants that will be harvested during the winter in the late summer so that they can have enough time to grow before the short days of winter arrive; they will be dormant (i.e. not growing) at that point but still harvestable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think an appropriate strategy would be to start small and experiment to figure out what *your* right size is. Set up some hoops over your garden to protect a handful of different winter crops. Keep track of how much space you allocate, what you've planted, and how much you can harvest and eat. Use this information to scale up your winter protection, and possibly to make adjustments to your crop selection, management, and harvesting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A complementary strategy would be to increase the size of your summer garden so that you can have vegetables preserved for winter use. Winter squash, potatoes, and onions all store easily, and many more vegetables can be stored for months if you can provide a proper storage facility. (Apples and other fruits too, if you take a food forest approach to gardening.) Even if you don't have a good root cellar, you can preserve many other foods in a variety of ways. If you're processing your own chickens when there's a lot of vegetables available, use them in vegetable-heavy soups. (It makes the meat stretch farther.) These soups can be canned and enjoyed all winter long. I keep bags of greens (kale, spinach, chard) in the freezer for use in recipes during the winter -- lasagna, soups, quiche, etc. If you don't like the energy used by a freezer, most of these can be dried effectively as well, and stored for long periods that way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, to put a number on it, let's say that you want to provide four 4oz salads (4oz of fresh greens only) a day for 6 months (October 1 through March 31). That's a pound a day for 180 days -- 180 pounds. A decent yield for spring-grown spinach would be about 1 pound per square foot, lettuce perhaps 2 lb/sqft. To make up a number, let's say you average about .5 lb/sqft for winter-harvested greens. You'd need a greenhouse with 360 square feet of **growing space**, plus space for paths, whatever heating you are going to provide, and whatever else you might keep in the building. It's a fairly simple formula, so you can play with the numbers, but until you *know* what your numbers really are (i.e. the strategy above), it's just a guess.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*(I'm assuming greens above because they're among the easiest things for winter harvest, and to keep the answer simpler. Carrots and parsnips can be harvested in winter too as long as you keep the ground from freezing around them, but they don't need a greenhouse. I cribbed the yield numbers from Jeavons, because I had it handy.)*" />

Some impact categories to think about: carbon footprint/global warming potential, energy consumption, ecotoxicity, human health, water consumption. All of these are pretty commonly used. There is a lot of research on LCA methods, both on how to collect the basic data and how to transform it into these impact categories. Two common methods include the EPA's [TRACI][2] or the european [ReCiPe][3]. Ideally, LCA's provide a quantitative and clear answer, but that's rarely true - they are quantitative though, which is really important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some of your later questions, particularly around batteries, the answers will depend on the study. The technical terms here are allocation and boundary conditions. Do we model battery recycling? who gets the benefits of it? what technologies are we looking at, and what other products do those produce? What impacts or processes do we include or exclude? There are generally a lot of assumptions, which need to be made and defended to move forward - though often they need to be revised for new technology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer your initial question, there was a poorly done report from years ago that purported to show that older Priuses were 'worse' than a Hummer in terms of energy usage. The report was [debunked][4] all over the place, but it is true that we've gotten better at making batteries over time. New hybrids have much lower impacts than the originals, and keeping the car longer will definitely decrease the relative impact (one of the assumptions is about how long cars last). Check out a newer study [here][5]. In terms of toxicity, here's an [older][6] and [newer][7] study on the topic - it can take some study to get a reasonable answer, and it's rarely clear-cut.

Some biased sources claim they are devilspawn. Other sources, biased in the other direction, claim they're heaven-sent. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  So take this absolute raking with a grain of salt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that even without biodiesel, a diesel vehicle is more sustainable than a gasoline vehicle.  All other things equal, diesel gets roughly 33% better fuel economy than gasoline per fuel volume.  Diesel refining is also, arguably, less harmful to the environment than gasoline.  And lastly, a diesel engine is mechanically simpler than a gasoline engine, and thus will last longer (500k miles is common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest looking for a good quality used diesel vehicle.  A 2000-2003 Jetta TDI is the ideal right now, easily over 50mpg highway.  But even the newer Jettas still get excellent fuel economy, and the older ones can, too. My '86 gets about 40mpg.  My '03 about 52mpg." />

So there are round trips which would involve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, but which could be sustainable. Obviously the round trip would be a net consumer of energy, but the price of energy differs by time, place and form, so this can still be economically viable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, one way to look at the relationship between pollution and sustainability is this:  &#xD;&#xA;**if there are procedures in place to reverse the pollution; and / or if the rate of release of pollutants is less than the sink rate of the environment, and if the pollutants' pathways from source to sink does not cause collateral harm on the way, then it could be sustainable. Otherwise, it is unsustainable.**" />

You can purchase it in bulk, and it has many uses other than just in washing your skin. It's one of those versatile things like baking soda and vinegar which have dozens of uses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A plastic-free alternative is a bar soap, I like the Kiss Your Face pure olive oil soap because it has a paper wrap and the only two ingredients are saponified olive oil and salt. You can also buy rather large bars (more product per packaging). Many stores sell bulk soap (such as some Whole Foods, natural food stores and co-ops) but you probably have to be careful about reading the ingredients.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are ambitious you could probably make your own soap, which is best left for somebody with experience to answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hair**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shampoo and conditioner can be completely eliminated in favor of castile soap (such as Dr. Bronners) or the &quot;no poo&quot; method, which uses baking soda as a shampoo and dilute vinegar as a conditioning rinse. Personally I have used the &quot;no poo&quot; method for several years and get comments about how great my hair looks, and I think it feels and looks amazing. There are many resources for the &quot;no poo&quot; method (just do a Google search and you will get a ton of hits) but [here is a good blog post with an explanation][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coloring of hair can be done with henna, [this great blog post on My Plastic-free Life][2] shows a couple henna methods (buying henna in bulk, and using a henna bar from Lush). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm hoping somebody else can comment on other hair products, which I tend not to use. I have seen [many recipes for flax hair gel][3] but I'm not sure what is used to replace hair spray, although [this post suggests using sugar or sea salt mixed with water][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Deodorant**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This has been touched on in another post on this forum][5]. To sum up: baking soda works miracles!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Teeth**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It can be difficult to find an eco-friendly toothbrush, which was highlighted in [this great post on My Plastic-free life][6]. I like the Preserve recycled toothbrushes because they are so easy to find, easy to recycle and don't cost a lot of money. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For toothpaste, you can make a tooth powder using baking soda, salt and cinnamon (just Google for tooth powder recipes). However, I have heard this is bad for your gums as it's very abrasive and I've stopped using it. [This post on My Plastic-free life goes over a ton of homemade toothpastes and other alternatives][7].  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as dental floss goes, I like [eco dent floss][8] which comes with only minimal plastic in the package (to keep the floss fresh). The floss has no teflon coating yet is still very good at gliding between the teeth. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have yet to find the best floss alternative for teeth that can't be flossed conventionally (for those of us with braces or a permanent retainer), but super floss (or the drugstore no-name brand) has minimal plastic in the packaging at least. If you found a good, reusable floss threader that would also be an option, although I find them to be very bulky (i.e. hard to fit between my teeth) and very cheap/disposable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Face / Makeup**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Face washing can be accomplished with castile soap (such as Dr. Bronners), some people suggest using the tea tree version of Bronners or adding a few drops of tea tree oil to your favorite castile soap. A lot of people swear that using castile soap has cured their acne problems, but I would take that with a grain of salt as it doesn't work for severe acne. I also like Desert Essence face wash, although it does come in a plastic container you can find it in quart sized bottles which lasts a very long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[My Plastic-free life has a recipe for making your own facial masque using items from a bulk foods store][9]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I enjoy [Organic Essence lip balm][10] which comes in a biodegradable container and has all USDA organic certified ingredients. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully somebody else can comment on makeup, as I haven't phased out my collection to anything approaching sustainable as of yet. I know there are a lot of organic makeup brands out there, but I can't vouch for their actual sustainability or quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hair removal**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For shaving, I absolutely love my Merkur safety razor. I had a no name brand safety razor for a while, until the screw on the head broke off and I couldn't get it fixed. The good thing with Merkur is that I've heard they will fix them if they break. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The blades are stainless steel and if you don't have coarse hair, can last a very long time. I have a package of Lord safety razor blades ([for example, on Amazon][11]) that came with no plastic in the packaging. I haven't even used up one small container of 5 in the couple of years I've been using the Merkur razor, so a package of 100 will probably last a long time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are adventurous enough you could try a straight razor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have found that I don't' miss shaving cream at all, I simply use liquid castile soap or lather with my bar soap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as waxing goes, you can use a sugar wax if you're comfortable doing your own waxing.

If, however, it does not include consumption of the product and its direct consequences, then your system boundary is too small.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For transport, we typically use a well-to-wheel basis. That's a generic description that applies even when the fuel doesn't come from a well (and even if the transport doesn't have wheels), and relates to the supply chain from initial extraction to the transport itself and the direct consequences, but not the indirect consequences such as changes in land use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Is the question meaningful?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neither petrol (gasoline) nor diesel are at all sustainable. Both score zero for sustainability. And there is little to choose between their unsustainability: the trade-offs being some increase in NOx and particulates, for some decrease in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrocarbons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both release carbon dioxide (and other pollutants) during combustion; and that is leading us to catastrophic climate change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both come from crude oil, which is a finite, depletable resource.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The extraction of crude oil itself is environmentally destructive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this means that the refining of each is environmentally unsustainable too: the production of each is unsustainable, along the entire supply chain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the question, as posed, is not meaningful: it does not make any sense to ask about the sustainability of just the refining part of petrol (gasoline) or diesel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And given that the entire supply chain for each is unsustainable, it does not make any sense to talk about the relative sustainability of one part of that supply chain: sustainability by its very nature is an issue that concerns the whole system, not just one component.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###But which is worse?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to the [Life Cycle Assessment of&#xD;&#xA;Vehicle Fuels and Technologies (2006, London Borough of Camden)][1], diesel CO2 emissions are 16% lower than petrol on a life cycle basis (p36). However, particulate and NOx emissions from diesel are significantly worse (p37), with petrol NOx being only 60% of diesel NOx. Petrol has worse hydrocarbon emissions (p38). Those are on a unit-distance basis. Conversely, the unit-energy basis is used in the [UK DTI report from 2003, Life Cycle Assessment of Vehicle Fuels and Technologies][2], which gives total GHG emissions of 87gCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/MJ for ultra low sulphur diesel, and 81gCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/MJ for unleaded petrol (gasoline) (Table II).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary: there's really not much too choose between them. They're both completely unsustainable, in only slightly different ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://transact.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Camden%20LCA%20Report%20FINAL%2010%2003%202006.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file14925.pdf" />

This will vary from apartment to apartment.  Human ingenuity is a marvellous thing so I will not say it is impossible to practically re-use grey water but it sounds like a real challenge.  Note that not all apartments are the same and water re-use may take unusual forms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a conventional graywater system a lot of different water sources are blended together and these have different properties.  Runoff from the shower is combined with runoff from the washing machine for example.  In your case I don't see how this could be made to work.  If you have your own laundry facilities, you might be able to come up with a way to harvest, for example, washing machine runoff, but it won't be quite the same thing but rather much more specific.  Consequently the question is if you get only a small portion of the gray water what then?  At any rate if you can modify the water out pipes from your laundry washing machine (dishwashers will be more complex due to space requirements) you might have a source of re-usable water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From that point the question is what you can do with it, since it is unlikely to be conventional gray water.  There may in fact be many uses possible.  I am not sure I would want to harvest water from the detergent-based laundry cycle and put on my plants, but the rinse cycle might be good for that.  The soap cycle however might be a useful bit of water you could use for washing recycling out or for other purposes and then discarded, essentially re-using both the detergent and the water." />

If you are serious about making preserves every year, you might want to invest in glasses. The rubber seals should officially be changed every time, but tend to last much longer than that.

Following this definition, something is either sustainable or not sustainable; sustainability cannot be “improved” or “worsened” (or it is merely the time before depletion that changes).&#xD;&#xA;We are faced to the issue of sustainability because we live in a finite world, with limited amounts of the natural resources we depend upon. When we get rid of rubbish, we often condemn useable material to idleness, which brings us to constantly extract raw material. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Recycling means using raw material that has already been extracted; this reduces the need to extract even more of it to meet consumption wants. Simply enough, to be sustainable or to avoid depletion, the rate of extraction must be brought lower or equal to the natural replenishment rate. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our use of forests is a good example of unsustainability : world forest cover has been shrinking quickly in the last decade, jeopardizing future generations' ability to enjoy its services (not only generations of humans, but also generations of animal forest dwellers). By recycling forestry products, such as paper and cardboard, we reduce the pressure put on forests and do not impede the latter's ability to replenish. In addition, making paper products form recycled fibers is much less energy demanding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, here's the drawback :&#xD;&#xA;Products made from recycled materials are often of lesser quality than the object for which the material was previously used. This is called downcycling; the idea that raw material cannot be reused infinitely is intrinsic to it. Also, recycling is an unsustainable activity if it engenders the excessive use of other resources (e.g. Oil for transportation, or energy for transformation). This may occur for certain materials that are shipped overseas to be managed in developing countries at a lower [financial, not environmental] cost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Still, most of the time, recycling is effective in reducing the demand for raw products and energy. This is especially true when the recycled objects are made from substances that takes very long to regenerate, such as oil (of which all plastics are made).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For recycling to be unquestionably sustainable, it is necessary to review the way the material is transformed and re-processed. And for that reason, reusing before recycling is even better as we aim for sustainability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more information :&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Recycle Everything: Why We Must – How We Can (Janet Unruh, 2010)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Story of Stuff (Annie Leonard, 2010)" />

Do not underestimate the value of adding newspaper and card to the bin on a regular basis - every time you add anything else in fact. Often times the layers of dry should be as frequent and slightly thicker than the layers of moist (most stuff).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The top might be just damp but that can often hide that the lower levels are soaked and attracting too many flies or it can be that rotting food is calling them in. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have seen a lot of bins that the owners swear blind are balanced but are in fact just too wet. This can be a health hazard when blow fly are involved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*If it is too wet*&#xD;&#xA;If the bin is too moist you can often tell by the bad smell when you get in close and/or by excessive seepage from the bottom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes the issue is drainage - the liquid is not able to escape the bin into the soil below. Maybe the soil is too hard, too much clay and not enough sand or looser material. In which case the bin needs a lot more dry especially lower down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can try sprinkling fine (silver) sand into the compost bin or you may need to simply refrain from adding any vegetative or other most/wet in for a few weeks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stale bread, card, wax free paper plates, most animal bedding, sawdust, toilet role tubes, pizza boxes, egg cartons, hair... there is a lot of dry that you could be adding but your real issue is that the dry is on top and the damp is at the bottom. I can't really recommend mucking that out with a big spade because... let's just say slime and stink and stop there. The problem is that turning it is the best bet... sorry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it is a shady spot bringing it into full sunlight will help. It's better to need to give the pile a drink once a month in the summer than to have it too wet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A big culprit is grass cuttings laid in too thick (also teabags and kitchen waste piled too high without dry). The grass can seem almost dry but releases a lot of moisture as it breaks down. Try to get a thin layer of grass between to layers of dry. It never hurts to have sand or twigs below grass to let the air in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*If the problem is fruit, black or vinegar flies*&#xD;&#xA;If you have a lot of tiny flies these may be vinegar flies in which case then the compost might be about right for moisture but not for containment. These guys look a lot like fruit flies and can be killed off by simply leaving a container of vinegar with a small opening nearby. They will often drown themselves for you. However you need to stop them moving in to start with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Killing them efficiently does not deal with the problem that attracted too many black flies, fruit flies and vinegar flies to your garden. They have come for the food and one way to stop this is to cover it up. Cover any food or vegetative scraps with a light layer of soil and follow this up with a few inches of brown material (ripped up newspaper, leaves, pencil shavings, plastic free junk mail or straw are all good). Two to four inches should do it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should certainly never leave food scraps on the top exposed. This is asking for trouble but most of us have done it. The lid is only going to protect the bin so much. I know of one gentleman who found that his wife had been dumping the peelings into the compost bin and not putting the lid on correctly- when he came back from a week long business trip in mid summer he had a garden full of flies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have been growing and curing tobacco it can make a natural pesticide but if you are growing your own you probably are trying to avoid toxins to start with." />

It does not apply to vegetables or meat, or to cases where large amounts of sugar are not added.  If canning in those environment, please use more conservative approaches, or better yet from a sustainability perspective use more traditional means of preserving these foods for later, such as sauerkraut and salami.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fruit is not considered to be a particular risk when canning and if you go back a thousand years or so fruit preserved in sugar was stored open.  The acidity and sugar together combine to prevent harmful bacteria from growing, and white sugar is considered, at least by archaeologists, to be better at preserving fruit than honey is (see &quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot; by Ann Hagen).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally there are a few fruit which have fallen out of favor which are traditionally preserved with citrus added, most notably the quince (&quot;marmalade&quot; comes from a word meaning &quot;quince jelly&quot;).  If going outside of the common fruit used for such preserves, you may want to test pH (which may be a good idea anyway).  If in doubt, add some extra lemon juice or other acidic fruit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, even in the Middle Ages, such preserves were cooked, both before bottling and after bottling, so you can't omit the water bath.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For fruit preserves, a pH of 4 gives you extra room in case the pH rises due to any number of factors.  Also note that fermented foods generally (that includes either lactic fermented foods like sauerkraut and alcoholic fermented foods like beer) are not botulism risks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more on safety, please see:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/ill-intox/botu-eng.php&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/communicable/fact-sheets/botulism-food-borne.htm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As always, defence in depth is important  and canning is a part of that depth today when making fruit preserves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Main answer**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The old traditional method of sealing was to use wax.  There's no reason why a &quot;float&quot; of beeswax won't get you where you need to go along with jars which cannot themselves be sealed.  While this often works it is not perfect and the seal can break.  This being said there isn't any reason why this can't be used as one aspect of a seal.  It may not be perfect, but it is simple to do, and if the product is used within a few months, it is likely sufficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another option, as you mention, is to re-use existing jam jars and lids.  I have done this with herbal medicine concoctions.  This usually works pretty well but some sorts of jars and lids I have learned to avoid not because they won't seal but because sometimes the seals end up locked and the jars impossible to open.  Jars to avoid include baby food jars.  I would assume that other similar jars should be avoided too.  Note you can test a seal with these by virtue of the fact that the button pops down.  If this doesn't happen, try a wax seal on these, and use first." />

Here's how they describe it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; MailStop Shield opts you out of the marketing lists that data brokers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; share with companies you have not done business with, which reduces&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unwanted advertising mail. We resubmit your data broker opt-outs on a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; regular basis to ensure your name and address stay off the lists being&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shared. We will also continue to add new data brokers to our lists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are other options you can do yourself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The Direct Marketing Association**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to cut out a lot of the junk mail coming to your house in one blow, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) is the way to go. It's not a federal program like the Do Not Call Registry but most reputable direct marketers belong to the DMA, and they offer an opt-out service to you, the consumer. You fill out a form with the DMA, then they compile a list of those who do not wish to receive unsolicited mail and send it to client companies who order these lists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are three ways to register with the DMA's opt-out service: you can simply send a post card with your name and address to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mail Preference Service&#xD;&#xA;Direct Marketing Association&#xD;&#xA;PO Box 643&#xD;&#xA;Carmel, NY 10512&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your name will be added to the list. However this can take about a month to process with the DMA, as well as time for it to feed out to their client organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also a form provided on their web site that you can fill out and mail in to the same address as above. Filling out the form online gives it a unique tracking number that enables them to process the request faster than if you just send in a post card.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly you can fill out the online form and submit it online. This processes your application immediately and should result in the flow of junk mail slowing within a period of about 1 month.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to find out more about the DMA's Mail Preference Service check out their web site at http://www.dmaconsumers.org&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Opt-out of Junk Mail With Individual Companies**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not every company works in conjunction with the DMA's Mail Preference Service that allows for mass opt-out. However, many companies do provide forms to fill out so that you don't appear in the lists for their junk mail or to have your address distributed by them. Even if they don't have forms or a proper method in place you can still contact them either through their web site, snail mail or calling customer service and get something sorted out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the idea that we, the consumer, should have to go the extra mile in order to ensure that our names and addresses are not sold from here to Timbuktu and that we not receive unsolicited mail is ridiculous, but unfortunately it is also a fact of life. At least until tougher laws are passed and tighter regulations enforced on the direct marketing industry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The place to start individual opting out are businesses that you are in regular contact with. Your bank is a prime target. Also anytime a store asks you for your name and address, ask them what they do with the information and what you need to do to make sure it is not used to send junk mail to your house. Opt-out before they even have a chance to opt you in involuntarily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is an example of what I am talking about: in the summer of 2005 I went to a major furniture chain to purchase a freezer. When I made the purchase, they wanted information such as my name and address. I asked them what they would be using the information for and reluctantly they told me it would be used to send solicitations from them to my house.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I told them I did not want any junk mail coming to my house. They said ok, and before I left I fill out a three page form saying that I wanted no unsolicited mail from them coming to my house. All well and good, or so I thought. Then, a couple of months later they sent me a flyer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I called them, quite upset. After all the trouble I had gone through to fill out the forms so I would get no mail, I still got it in my mailbox. After some arguing with the manager I got him to take my name off the list, and since then I have not received any junk mail from them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Opt-out Telephone Numbers and Addresses**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here now we will look at contact information for a few businesses that engage in direct marketing. One of the worst types of junk mail are the constant credit card applications coming every day. These junk mailings are for the most part the work of three companies: Experian, Trans Union and Equifax, the big three credit reporting companies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three companies are the ones responsible for compiling all of the data that goes into creating your credit score. They are also to blame for the majority of credit card applications sent to your house. If you want these to stop, there is one simple telephone number you can call:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1-888-5OPTOUT or 1-888-567-8688&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will stop you from receiving junk mail from any of the big three credit reporting companies and should also stop the majority of the credit card applications coming your way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below are the addresses of many of the worst culprits in sending junk mail. Write them and tell them that you wish to opt-out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Publishing Clearinghouse Sweepstakes&#xD;&#xA;101 Channel Dr&#xD;&#xA;Port Washington, NY 11050&#xD;&#xA;1-800-645-9242&#xD;&#xA;1-800-453-0272 (fax)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;American Business information inc.&#xD;&#xA;Attn: Product Quality&#xD;&#xA;PO Box 27347&#xD;&#xA;Omaha, NE 68127&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Donnelly Marketing, inc&#xD;&#xA;Attn: Data Base Operations&#xD;&#xA;PO Box 3502&#xD;&#xA;Ames, IA 50010-3502&#xD;&#xA;888-633-4402&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haines and Company, inc.&#xD;&#xA;Criss-Cross Directory&#xD;&#xA;Attn: Director of Data Processing&#xD;&#xA;8050 Freedom Ave&#xD;&#xA;NW Canton, OH 44720&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is just a few of the worst offenders. There are many others out there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The USPS and Form 1500**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although for the most part the USPS is not at all interested in assisting you to stop or opt-out of junk mail, they do have one resource available to you, the consumer: Form 1500. This form is designed to stop explicit and pornographic material from being sent to your home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You pick up the form from the post office (you can also find it online) fill it out and can stop all mail from being delivered to you coming from a certain company. While this is generally supposed to refer only to explicit and pornographic materials, the onus is on you for determining what is explicit and pornographic.

To break those bonds on many aluminum alloys requires chemicals and often quite a bit of electricity.  Most of these chemicals are highly toxic, and create hazardous waste.  The effort, waste, and pollution created by recycling these alloys is more damaging to the earth than just discarding the alloy which is chemically stable, and does not create hazardous waste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/453/141" />

[...] greywater that is not being actively purified by plants, animals, and soil microbes will culture pathogenic microbes quickly, becoming black water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an apartment, you don't have a yard, trees, etc to dispose of greywater immediately and might be tempted to store it for a period of time. Keep the warning above in mind, and make use of your greywater appropriately. A bit of planning in timing your water-generating and water-using activities might be helpful. (E.g. do laundry when you need to water plants.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Sources&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Dish water** is controversial as a source of greywater -- I often see it categorized as blackwater. If you do your dishes by hand in a tub, then you don't have to worry about modifying any plumbing. Dish water may be categorized as blackwater because it will often contain grease, fat/oil, and food particles and you (a) don't really want to dump this on plants -- especially houseplants -- or (b) want to keep it hanging around for very long.&#xD;&#xA;* If you have a **washing machine** in your apartment, it should be easy to reconnect the outflow hose to a bucket. Just make sure (a) the bucket is big enough and (b) the hose is securely attached so that you don't make a mess! (Again, hopefully it's obvious, but if you're washing baby diapers then this is *blackwater* -- don't keep it hanging around, flush it away.)&#xD;&#xA;* If the drain pipes connected to your **sinks** are accessible, they are usually easy to disassemble (either unscrew or slide the pipes apart). You can put a bucket underneath, just be careful that it doesn't overflow. (The same note re: blackwater applies here if you're doing dishes by hand, or if you manage to disconnect the kitchen sink below a dishwasher outlet.)&#xD;&#xA;* If you can't get to the sink pipes, consider placing a **bowl in the sink** to catch water when you wash your hands.&#xD;&#xA;* Similarly, men can **shave** with a bit of water in a bowl instead of letting the water go down the drain.&#xD;&#xA;* I think taking a bath is probably a bigger water waster than taking a quick shower, so I don't think it's worth switching to baths just so you can reuse the water, but if you do take baths, you can scoop out most of the water with a pail before opening the drain. (You'll either need someplace to store it, or you'll have to be able to use it right away though. And if you have little ones in the house, don't keep a tub full of bath water hanging around!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Uses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Any extra water can be used for **flushing**, but you should use the &quot;dirtiest&quot; water for this first since it is the last use that water will have. If you're storing the water in a bucket, you can just dump a gallon right into the bowl to flush.&#xD;&#xA;* If you grab the **soapy water** from the washing machine, you can use it for washing dirty stuff -- scrubbing the toilet bowl, cleaning out trash cans, etc.&#xD;&#xA;* The cleaner water can be used for **watering plants**. Be careful about what you use for cleaning products, and you can probably use the water on more of your plants. Be careful about what water you use on plants that you're eating directly -- I don't think I'd use bath water on my spinach, for example.&#xD;&#xA;* If you have a top-load washing machine, you could pour in some of your cleaner water into the **initial rinse water**.&#xD;&#xA;* If you want to all-out, you can build a [**slow sand filter**](http://tilz.tearfund.org/Publications/Footsteps+31-40/Footsteps+35/The+household+slow+sand+filter.htm) -- even if you don't get the water back to fully potable, you can at least move it back up the cascade a stage or two, and/or allow it to be safely stored for longer periods. E.g. perhaps the washing machine outflow can be reused, assuming you can dump into a top-loader." />

From a permaculture perspective, this is my Zone 4; Zone 5 lies along the back edge of the woodlot. I'm in the northeast USA, USDA Zone 5 -- it was recently -10°F (-20°C) during a cold snap. Acidic, loamy, gravelly soil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The species makeup is mainly beech and Eastern hemlock; with significant amounts of sugar maple and white pine; and smaller amounts of black cherry, ash, paper birch, and spruce. I harvest using a selective cutting strategy -- removing diseased or damaged trees first, then less-desirable species (hemlock has lower energy density than beech or maple), and paying attention to the amount of light and wind that I'm letting in via cuts as well as which mature species are left in place to scatter seed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The woodlot is just for firewood and wildlife; it is not used for other crops or pasture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not plant anything back there. Actually, in areas where I have thinned and lots of sunlight is reaching the floor I think I am &quot;overstocked&quot;. Many seedlings are growing up very densely -- which leads me to the question: **What guidelines should I follow for thinning?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* How do I know how densely various species should be growing for optimum yield? It seems obvious that beech shouldn't be grown 4-6&quot; apart, but how many should I remove?&#xD;&#xA;* Which seedlings should I (de-)select? (I.e. which to cut and which to keep.)&#xD;&#xA;* Is it sensible to deselect the (less energy dense) softwoods and encourage the hardwoods? I don't want to destroy biodiversity, but I don't want to maintain the current ~30-50% hemlock makeup -- or, in one area, ~80% white pine saplings. Also, encouraging sugar maple makes the land more valuable -- sugaring businesses are active in the area, and these trees provide ongoing yields without having to cut them down.&#xD;&#xA;* Should I thin in phases? E.g. aim for a certain density when the seedlings are under 6' (2m) and then a certain lower density when they get to say 15' (5m).&#xD;&#xA;* Is there an ideal time of year to thin? I don't think seedlings are strong enough to regrow when cut, but perhaps some slightly larger trees would -- timing thinning to minimize regrowth (and rework) would be nice.&#xD;&#xA;* Is there any consideration I should give to yields that I can get from thinning? It's quite a bit of work, and I'd love to be able to get something out of it *now*, instead of waiting to get everything 40 years from now. (Note that I'm obviously in this for the long haul, but I'm more than willing to get a yield from what would otherwise be waste.)" />

Currently we control these with periodic, carefully timed insecticide application (this cockroach has a slow growth cycle so right now that means 3-4 times/year, 2-3 applications per time).  We spray heavily in bathrooms which have little ventillation, let sit for hours, and then open up to ventillate.  This seems to work but I don't like the implications of using pesticides in this way or manner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We believe that the pests enter from outside, and climb into the pipes from the drains in the back garden.  Because of the setup it has not been particularly possible to put screens on those drains with small enough holes to discourage these pests.  Additionally they may wander in the front door (I am not kidding, I have seen this) and then scurry around until hidden, waiting until later to find drains to crawl into.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What additional means are there to control/prevent infestations of cockroaches?  I suspect that this species is likely to be the easiest to get rid of, of the cockroaches, because despite the fact that it runs *fast* and that the adults can fly, it takes 6-12 months for young to reach sexual maturity (a bit over 4x the time the German Cockroach requires).  I would assume then that methods of controlling other cockroaches might be effective here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is worth noting I have not seen any evidence that they are in our food (we do have geckos but that's another story, and the problems there are simply prevented by being careful about keeping food containers closed).

If you don't measure what you're doing, you don't know if you're even making an improvement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some cars have a fuel efficiency gauge on the dash but I don't recommend watching this as you drive.  The times at which the greatest gains can be made (i.e. accelerating) are exactly the same times when the most concentration is required to ensure you don't crash.  Crashing is not fuel efficient.  If you have an efficiency gauge in your car, check it at the end of each journey, not while you are driving.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't have one or even if you do, the tried and true method of *writing it down when you fill up on fuel* is my recommendation.  For years when I owned a car I kept a notepad in the glove box that contained pre-drawn columns:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    _______________________________________________________________________&#xD;&#xA;    |Date    |Odometer    |Fuel quantity    |Fuel cost    |Notes           |&#xD;&#xA;    |        |            |                 |             |                |&#xD;&#xA;    |        |            |                 |             |                |&#xD;&#xA;    |        |            |                 |             |                |&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From these values, you can calculate how far you traveled since the last fill-up and how much fuel you used to travel that distance and from that, what your *fuel efficiency* was.  The cost isn't necessary for calculating efficiency but I found that information interesting too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Make sure to fill up consistently the same way each time.  This is usually achieved by simply holding the fuel pump trigger until it clicks off automatically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can also buy car travel logs with similar columns (they usually have both *Start odometer* and *End odometer* columns).  In this modern age of iPhones, Andriods and 3G, you can enter your travel details straight into websites designed to calculate your fuel efficiency such as [Fuelly][1] and [MPGTune][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have been recording your actual fuel usage for a while, start changing one of the above suggestions at a time and don't change anything else for several fill-ups.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to add a few notes from personal experience from when I went through improving my fuel efficiency.  I was driving a large 4WD so the fuel costs hurt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first two ideas I tried were what are called above **defensive driving** and **don't accelerate too fast**.  Leaving a large gap in front of me meant that often the traffic lights would go green before I even needed to brake, meaning I didn't need to accelerate again and waste fuel.  Accelerating slowly simply uses less fuel to reach the same speed (but takes longer) however in small city traffic, I would usually catch the people who accelerated off ahead of me at the next set of red lights so I didn't end up being late due to my changed driving style.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With these two techniques, I improved my *measured* fuel efficiency from 15L/100Km to 11L/100Km.  (That's roughly 15mpg up to 21mpg).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't get to try any further ideas as I moved to London, sold my car and bought a bike.  The fuel efficiency of a bike is generally given to be [53 miles per burrito][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.fuelly.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.mpgtune.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.missionbicycle.com/store/53-miles-burrito" />

I would expect that this has a number of benefits for the soil such as reduced erosion. I would suggest phasing the thinning.  This has a few benefits including the fact that you may get more initial growth for things like kindling out of the initial high speed growth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest during the thinning phase, assuming young trees, that a simple rule might be that if the heads of the trees are touching, you can probably afford to thin half of the trees.  That gives them room to grow for the next phase without thinning them so far you might worry about too much erosion in the spring with the runoff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest also removing the weaker and smaller saplings if there is a difference there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for yelds, if you can saw the small logs on a jig and dry them out they can be useful for kindling in a wood stove.  We heat our house in Chelan with apple wood which cannot be easily split due to the way it has been pruned, and we just use smaller rounds as kindling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Species Selection**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I share your concerns here.  I don't think there is a problem with selecting based on species in order to shift yields. This is a more tricky subject and probably pretty locally dependent so rather than try to provide a definitive answer, I will mention a few things to keep in mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many forests have an internal species progression where established trees of one species group enable the next stage of the progression to become established.  These progressions can take hundreds of years in some forests to reach maturity and obviously you don't want to wait that long.  In fact I know of old growth forests in national parks in Washington State, where such a progression has not reached maturity and probably won't for another few hundred years, assuming no fires or the like  (for example in Mt Ranier National Park a lot of the old growths in the lower areas are doug fir-dominated, but the next phase will be Western Hemlock)....  At the same time you may want to be familiar with it because you may be trying to either back things out or push things forward.   Being aware of such cycles is the first step in trying to harness them and it may shape the way you look at species selection. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I understand it, in your area, beech and maple are probably the pinnacle species, so one thing you should keep in mind is that eventually these trees will likely dominate the other species.  Additionally these species are co-dependent, each reproducing best in the shade of the other." />

Nonetheless, here are some back of the hand calculations for reading a 1/2 lb book once and recycling it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we start with US government figures and work back we get slightly under 1kWH per lb of paper in the recycling process.  Keep in mind printing still has to be taken into account and that isn't cheap either.  If we are comparing to a kindle, I couldn't find specific power figures (except that it *charges* at 5 w), that would mean you'd have to read for about 100 hours to make up for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the catch is as always, how much use does a book get?  If you read the Odyssey once every few years, you may quite easily get that 100 hours out of the book.  My 10lb (or maybe heavier) Compact Edition of the OED gets way more than 10k hours of usage over its life, let me tell you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the argument is likely to be an argument against *disposable* books rather than against printed books generally." />

For example more cheese-makers will make it harder to push for making it harder to purchase milk which hasn't had the proteins denatured via ultrapasteurization.

Currently we control these with periodic, carefully timed insecticide application (this cockroach has a slow growth cycle so right now that means 3-4 times/year, 2-3 applications per time).  We spray heavily in bathrooms which have little ventillation, let sit for hours, and then open up to ventillate.  This seems to work but I don't like the implications of using pesticides in this way or manner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We believe that the pests enter from outside, and climb into the pipes from the drains in the back garden.  Because of the setup it has not been particularly possible to put screens on those drains with small enough holes to discourage these pests.  Additionally they may wander in the front door (I am not kidding, I have seen this) and then scurry around until hidden, waiting until later to find drains to crawl into.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What additional means are there to control/prevent infestations of cockroaches?  I suspect that this species is likely to be the easiest to get rid of, of the cockroaches, because despite the fact that it runs *fast* and that the adults can fly, it takes 6-12 months for young to reach sexual maturity (a bit over 4x the time the German Cockroach requires).  I would assume then that methods of controlling other cockroaches might be effective here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is worth noting I have not seen any evidence that they are in our food (we do have geckos but that's another story, and the problems there are simply prevented by being careful about keeping food containers closed).  As far as I can tell the activity is entirely limited to the drain pipes, which go from the septic system (yes, everyone in Jakarta has a septic system) to things like the shower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit:  as a side note I have considered trying to introduce geckos to the drain pipes.  Not sure how well they would fare there though and that might be cruel so for now I have ruled that out." />

To achieve better mileage I would advocate the **appropriate driving**. The term _defensive driving_ relates to proactive risk management of on-road hazards, and can be done regardless of speed and acceleration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Arbitrary “slower speed” does not guarantee better fuel economy, as different vehicles have different optimal RPM range for any given gear (with highest gear being most economical). However, at motorway speeds aerodynamic drag plays ever increasing role, and that optimal RPM range is usually allows for lower speed than most people indulge themselves on the autobahn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a general rule, smooth acceleration and aptly timed deceleration is key, but there are instances where it does not hold true. For example if one pulls out of side street during a rush hour, and the choice is to accelerate rapidly to safely merge into traffic, or be faced with the long line of cars and couple of minutes of idling, the winner is clearly the former (more on evils of idling later).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Proper deceleration is important, because fast braking (even if one “drives defensively” well under speed limit) does nothing but converting kinetic energy into waste heat, whereas there are more efficient ways to slow down. Releasing throttle well ahead of time not only reduces wear of brake pads and tyres, but allows the car to use natural losses of energy (inside the engine and drivetrain, aerodynamic drag etc.) to slow itself down. Importantly, it has to be done in gear ([engine braking][1]) which qualifies as an _engine overrun_ condition (throttle is off and RPMs are higher than idle) at which point ECU on modern fuel-injected petrol motors _shuts off fuel delivery entirely_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible to greatly reduce need for acceleration by planning ahead and properly timing the traffic signals, slowing down well ahead of red lights in order to roll onto green, or accelerating when needed to make the green light, to avoid idling on red.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## On Evils of Idling&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next big thing is **to reduce idling**. Besides the obvious “burning fuel with no miles” (0 MPG), there are more serious mechanical consideration against idling (even aforementioned fuel shut-off during overrun was primarily introduced to protect catalytic converter from incomplete combustion). Those are [enumerated elsewhere on SE][2], but in short that incomplete combustion leads to reducing effectiveness of spark plugs (which, in turn, further reduces fuel economy), glazing of combustion chamber, contaminating of oil, and excessive amount of water in exhaust system which increases corrosion. Moreover, idling produces more pollution from the same amount of fuel. For those concerned about implication of frequent stopping and restarting the vehicle, there is some math in above link, and more [in another][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practicality, this means turning off engine at long stop lights, railroad crossings, at the corner shop, and so forth, and reducing time spent warming up. Modern engines warm up better when they are put under moderate load rather than idling. And in the winter, one should protect the windscreen from defrosting with covered parking or putting blanket on it overnight, and to wear weather appropriate clothing, and not waiting for the car interior to turn into sauna.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## More Better&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other suggestions are also true: **proper tyre pressure** (also, safety issue, as under-inflated tyres are at risk of overheating failure), **low rolling resistance tyres** ([some concerns addressed][4]), **diligent maintenance** (plugs, wires, oil and filters affect performance in little ways that can add up), and **removing unnecessary weight or aerodynamic impediments** (if you do not have skis or a bicycle on your roof rack, it has to go).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Outside of the mechanicals, **alternative transportation** (walking, biking, public transport, motorcycling) and **carpooling** can make an impact. Public transport generally takes longer time, but this time can be used more productively (reading, homework, work), one avoids traffic stress, parking costs, reduces wear, tear, and statistical possibility of an accident in own car. Also helps **avoiding rush hour** when possible, and **combining trips** (engine is more efficient at proper operating temperature, and many separate small trips do not allow motor to reach it).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keeping track of the fuel usage (I use Fuelly, [personally][5]) helps not only for monitoring effects of any particular approach, but can also point to problems if certain negative trends develop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above is very sensible practises that many can readily apply today in improving their driving habits without entering arcane realm of hardcore _hypermiling_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/3600/is-engine-braking-harmful/3610#3610&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/1772/is-idling-bad-for-your-engine/3428#3428&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/825/is-start-stop-technology-good-or-bad-for-my-car-alfa-mito/3566#3566&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/are-there-any-disadvantage-to-fuel-efficient-tires/3471#3471&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://www.fuelly.com/driver/theUg" />

Open the windows instead (if it's hot); close the windows &amp; wear a jacket (when it's cold). (This is for low speed; for longer stretches on the highway the drag by the open windows might waste more energy than the air-conditioning. See the comment by @JayBazuzi below.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Air pressure of your tyres**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Not the biggest factor, but you decrease wear (long-term benefit) and friction, which saves fuel on the day, so to speak (short-term benefit).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Defensive driving**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;... meaning try to drive without having to step on the brakes. Keep your distance from the cars in front of you. Take your foot of the gas when the traffic light turned to red. (But remember, braking is more cost-efficient than having an accident. Safety comes first, also for sustainability.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Avoid traffic**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Like the point above, avoid traffic, because in traffic you'll have to brake (for other cars, cyclists, children, traffic lights), which is necessary, but not fuel efficient. Scheduling a longer route around town may well be more efficient (esp. if you are driving defensively and slowly) and doesn't drive you up the wall. (You said that already, I know.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Reduce weight**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;No reason to drive around with unnecessary heavy objects in your trunk. Only take with you what you need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Drive slowly**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Driving twice as fast increases the air resistance 4-fold. Driving faster thus necessarily means you use more fuel for the same distance. (I mean, don't drive faster than everyone else, not drive slower than everyone else, forcing people to have to wait for you. That will result in aggression and risky overtaking manoeuvres of other people, using more net fuel...) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Make your car aerodynamic**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Don't transport anything on the roof (if possible). The air resistance is very high. If you do, drive slowly. (See &quot;Drive slowly&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't accelerate too fast**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Give your cylinders a chance to use all the fuel you give to them efficiently. Accelerating too fast results in incomplete combustion and more fuel being used for nothing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And a few obvious ones (for sake of completeness)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Form alliances**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Take your neighbours to the shopping mall and they'll return the favour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Only drive when necessary**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;You save the most fuel when you don't drive at all.

As you say, PV's efficiency tends to be significantly lower than solar thermal, in straight watt-for-watt terms, which means less power per unit roof area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And you're right that just using the electricity generated to create low-grade heat could be wasteful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Economics&#xD;&#xA;But exergy and economics are different: PV is becoming cheaper and cheaper. So maybe there are circumstances where PV + resistance heating is cheaper than solar thermal.  Misaligned incentives between PV and solar-thermal could make that happen, as could extremely cheap PV systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Deemed exports within Feed-in Tariffs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And there are cases, for example in the UK, where the payment to the PV system owner is based on the amount of electricity generated, and where there is a payment for electricity exported to the grid, but this is not measured - it's just deemed to be 50% of the total generated. Yes, that is a silly way to do things, given how cheap and easy it is to meter the exports, but that's the system some utilities are operating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Under such a regime, the PV is then built with a resistance heater in a hot-water storage-tank, and all the electricity gets dumped as low-grade heat into that tank.

The first potential advantage is how the variation throughout the year can be handled.  In a modern grid-tied solar PV system, you can bank electrical energy credits across many months, effectively generating power in July for use in January.  Thus the PV system can be sized based on the needed year-round average production instead of a guaranteed minimum production.  Looking at direct solar hot water, energy banking can usually only be done for a matter of days.  This means that a system with sufficient output in winter is likely to overproduce in summer.  If you heat with the solar hot water this is even more the case, since the system will be larger but heating is not needed during the maximum production months.  So the first potential advantage of PV over solar thermal is the percentage of generated energy that actually gets used, on a year-long basis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second potential advantage is simplicity.  A solar thermal system cannot offset the total energy use of a home, since much of this is used as electricity.  Therefore the homeowner desiring to offset the entire household usage would end up buying and maintaining two different types of systems.  If the homeowner expects to buy a solar PV system anyway, they may simply find it easier to buy a single system rather than determine the balance between two systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If trying to heat water most efficiently with electricity, a heat pump water heater will raise the effective ratio of energy used to heat gained from .9 (for direct heating) to about 2.4.  Thus, a 20% efficient solar panel (a high number, but taking it from the question) would effectively be 48% efficient at heating water." />

At low speeds, open the windows instead (if it's hot); close the windows &amp; wear a jacket (when it's cold). For high speed, close the windows, even when it's hot. At higher speeds the drag created by open windows uses more fuel than the air-conditioning. (See comment by Jay Bazuzi &amp; [reference](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2010/08/natures_air_conditioner.html) by walker below.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Air pressure of your tyres**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Not the biggest factor, but you decrease wear (long-term benefit) and friction, which saves fuel on the day, so to speak (short-term benefit).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Defensive driving**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;... meaning try to drive without having to step on the brakes. Keep your distance from the cars in front of you. Take your foot of the gas when the traffic light turned to red. (But remember, braking is more cost-efficient than having an accident. Safety comes first, also for sustainability.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Avoid traffic**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Like the point above, avoid traffic, because in traffic you'll have to brake (for other cars, cyclists, children, traffic lights), which is necessary, but not fuel efficient. Scheduling a longer route around town may well be more efficient (esp. if you are driving defensively and slowly) and doesn't drive you up the wall. (You said that already, I know.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Reduce weight**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;No reason to drive around with unnecessary heavy objects in your trunk. Only take with you what you need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Drive slowly**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Driving twice as fast increases the air resistance 4-fold. Driving faster thus necessarily means you use more fuel for the same distance. (I mean, don't drive faster than everyone else, not drive slower than everyone else, forcing people to have to wait for you. That will result in aggression and risky overtaking manoeuvres of other people, using more net fuel...) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Make your car aerodynamic**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Don't transport anything on the roof (if possible). The air resistance is very high. If you do, drive slowly. (See &quot;Drive slowly&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't accelerate too fast**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Give your cylinders a chance to use all the fuel you give to them efficiently. Accelerating too fast results in incomplete combustion and more fuel being used for nothing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And a few obvious ones (for sake of completeness)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Form alliances**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Take your neighbours to the shopping mall and they'll return the favour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Only drive when necessary**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;You save the most fuel when you don't drive at all. Take the bus or train or hitch a ride with friends or neighbours." />

There is no one universal answer. It will depend on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the source of your electricity&#xD;&#xA; - the rate of leakage of methane in your gas supply&#xD;&#xA; - the relative efficiencies of the gas and electricity cookers under consideration&#xD;&#xA; - the impact on your domestic heating / cooling energy consumption of the additional ventilation required when cooking with gas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it's not possible to give a specific answer, with regard to your three criteria. For the specifics of your own case, you'd need to look at lifecycle assessments (LCA) for each of the energy vectors. But let's look at some generalities:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###When would electricity be better?&#xD;&#xA;If your electricity supply is not preominantly coal, and you've got efficient electrical cooking (e.g. induction hob, microwave oven, well-insulated convection oven), then cooking with electricity is likely to be better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also likely that your electricity supply will get cleaner over the next 10 years, i.e. within the lifetime of any cooking device that you buy now, so the balance may tip towards electric within the lifetime of a cooker bought today.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###When would gas be better?&#xD;&#xA;If:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - you can source your gas as biogas or as renewably-synthetisised methane, or if your electricity supply is almost entirely coal- or oil- powered;&#xD;&#xA; - and if the whole supply chain of your gas has very low leakage rates (so, no shale gas, no leaky pipes, no leaky cooker)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;then cooking with gas is likely to be better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###When is it all bad?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your electricity is mostly coal, and your gas supply is as leaky as many seem to be, then cooking is going to be quite carbon-intensive either way; that is, there will be high greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy that actually gets delivered into cooking. In that case, the best option to take you closer to sustainability is find an energy provider who can supply you with cleaner electricity or gas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###On the positive side&#xD;&#xA;Cooking tends to be a pretty small part of overall energy consumption (a tiny few percent), so the overall environmental impact from cooking is likely to be a very small part of your total impact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Efficiencies&#xD;&#xA;Here#s a quick outline on some relevant efficiencies. The reciprocal of the overall efficiency is the multiplier for environmental damage: for example, an overall efficiency of 33% means that 1 unit of energy used directly for cooking does 3x the damage: An overall efficiency of 50% means 2x the damage. 25% means 4x the damage. etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - gas-powered electricity tends to be ~50% efficient&#xD;&#xA; - coal-powered electricity tends to be ~35% - 40% efficient&#xD;&#xA; - electricity distribution losses might be of the order of 5-10%&#xD;&#xA; - gas-distribution leakage rates can be [around 10%][1]&#xD;&#xA; - gas cookers can be ~[40% efficient][2]&#xD;&#xA; - electric cookers can be ~[70-90% efficient][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that methane has a global warming forcing of about 21-25, relative to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at the 100-year time horizon, so methane leakages are significant contributors to climate damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717351.100-leaking-gas-mains-help-to-warm-the-globe-.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/efficient-cooking&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/cookgtsd.pdf" />

So, for example, if you're going to trade in an old vehicle for a new one, and the garage you trade in at is going to strip down the old vehicle and use all the mechanical bits for spares, and all of the other materials will be recycled, then that would favour buying a new vehicles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, if disposing of an old dishwasher is going to lead to it being dumped in landfill, then the cost of extracting it back out of landfill and reusing the bits, and decontaminating the land afterwards, could be quite high, and that would favour repairing the old model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#A closing note on the economics&#xD;&#xA;You have quite reasonably said in your question that you are interested in the environmental impact, and not in the economics. I thought it might be useful to just note note for other readers why there is a difference between those two, and why they matter differently.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;###Economic theory&#xD;&#xA;In a perfect world, the economics would tell you everything you needed to know about the sustainability. If all externalities were priced in, and if the market were efficient, then the price would reflect everything you needed to know to answer this question - it would include whole-lifecycle costs, on a cradle-to-cradle basis, for each, using a sane discount rate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Economic reality&#xD;&#xA;Sadly, there remain many unpriced externalities; markets are often very inefficient; whole-lifecycle cradle-to-cradle costs can be difficult to discover; and people disagree on what a sane discount rate; so the economics can be a very poor guide, unfortunately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also a problem that there isn't a single universal standard for &quot;environmental impact&quot;: there are sometimes trade-offs to be made between greenhouse-gas emissions, freshwater usage, local pollution, and so on - it's very difficult to even agree the damage-cost function for a unit of freshwater pollution, because that will vary by time and place.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these gaps between the perfect market and markets as they are, create inefficiencies, and cultivate unsustainability and embed it into our economy. So, sometimes it can be more economically efficient to let what we know about environmental impact override what we observe as the market price: because there are areas where we know more about costs than what the market has priced in." />

These two aspects are sometimes contradicting each other. If the water source is plentiful, one well should be enough. Otherwise, consider two wells:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The drinking water one located at a higher place to minimize water pollution. Far from the gray-water recycling and/or humanure lot, etc..&#xD;&#xA;- The lower quality well for irrigation and bigger volume output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The wells should be far enough from each other so that the lower one wouldn't significantly drain the one above. This can be avoided by deeper drilling.  &#xD;&#xA;And both wells should be used regularly to prevent 'clogging'. It can take some time until the underground water makes its path to supplement the water requirements of the well. When the well isn't used for certain time, those paths can detoriate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it's possible, build a tank or a [retention basin][3] to keep the rain water for irrigation. It's the most sustainable way of using the rain water.  &#xD;&#xA;Even if it could seem as a good idea I wouldn't join the retention pond with the well.

Natural gas is natural resource just like petroleum. They arise from similar processes and are generally found together although the ratios vary. Natural gas (particularly methane) is also produced by living organisms. As a natural resource, 'pure' sustainability would require you to consume at a rate less than it's produced by nature. Since petroleum and natural gas for the most part produced on geologic timescale, they would not generally be considered sustainable. However if you take the premise that sustainable is 'relative' than you could compare and contrast different non-renewable resources for their relative sustainability. For example, it appears new cheaper supplies of natural gas in the United States have led to reduced use of coal for producing electricity ([ref][1]). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Natural gas is considered cleaner burning than coal so that is generally seen as better for the environment. The [WSJ article above][2] quotes the Sierra Club president with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here’s our position on gas: it burns more cleanly than coal or oil,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but it is not clean. When coal plants are retired (or new ones are not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; built), we believe that the right “loading order” for new energy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sources would be: energy conservation and efficiency, solar and wind&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (preferring distributed over large-scale), geothermal and perhaps some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; wave energy, then natural gas to fill in the rest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whether 'better for environment' is a sustainability topic is probably a separate question for the [meta][3] site. Independent of the environmental issue, natural gas vs gasoline vs coal vs renewable resources is a relative. My guess is that it would be a similar list to the Sierra Club list above. However, to do it correctly, you really would need to get to specific sources. One measure might be the energy needed to create a unit of energy. This [reference][4] compares petroleum from sand oil vs others and takes into account mining, extraction, transportation, and refining. I could not find a source but my guess would be that on average it would be less for natural gas than petroleum. However, just like in petroleum, it might be dependent on the source of the natural gas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703579804575441683910246338.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703579804575441683910246338.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.sustainability.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/29589/52906785.pdf?sequence=1&amp;ei=ThQmUe2IDsmn0gHOroDADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGuhPZgsoYdsOtiTquY2lk85h23Q&amp;bvm=bv.42661473,d.dmQ" />

If your food stays between 32F and 40F you can treat it as refridgerated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Frozen food itself is not in significant danger but you may need to watch for thaws.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Between 40F and about 60F there are a significant number of things you can do to keep food edible and safe.  First and foremost, uncooked food can be subject to moderate salting and then lactic fermentation (sauerkraut, salami, yogurt, cheese, traditional pickles, etc).  Note that these are all *live, cultured* foods and the combination of the pH and living culture are important.  Additionally many have added salt which aids preservation too.  Finally I would note that if you make traditional butter, you ferment the cream first and then salt it, and this way the butter will keep more than a few days.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chances are you aren't going to be above those temperatures so that should suffice.  If you are above those temperatures, alcoholic fermentation of fruit is possible and lactic fermentation, while possible, requires a great deal more salt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other concerns:  Yes, you do need to protect from animals and some animals are pretty crafty.  Ravens and racoons, for example, can easily get into all kinds of things.  Both these have been known to get into closed coolers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general you should assume low-grade contamination for food to be reheated.  The question is preventing it from being a problem (cold storage and refridgeration).  I don't see additional risk in being in a closed container well below freezing, but when it thaws, that could change fast.  You need to keep an eye on things." />

A lifeless lake is quick to &quot;erode&quot; or dry up, resulting in unfertile land and less flora and fauna.

Duplicating it outside of a lab environment is impractical.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check for published numbers, but they are not likely to be directly comparable to those published by other manufacturers unless your comparing recent numbers by European manufacturers.

The stickers usually fall off vinyl windows, however, so don't get your hopes up if you've had them long.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A simple home test can be done with a heat lamp.  Remove the sash and brace it into a standing position on a table.  Place the lamp 1 inch from the exterior glass perpendicular to the window.  Wait five minutes then turn off the lamp and quickly record the temperature of the interior glass with an IR thermometer.  Wait an hour for the window to return to ambient temperature then repeat on the opposite side.  You switch sides, because some low-e coatings are unidirectional and some are only applied to one plate.  Now subtract the ambient temperature from your two recorded numbers so you are left with temperature gain.

If your food stays between 32F and 40F you can treat it as refridgerated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Frozen food itself is not in significant danger but you may need to watch for thaws.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Between 40F and about 60F there are a significant number of things you can do to keep food edible and safe.  First and foremost, uncooked food can be subject to moderate salting and then lactic fermentation (sauerkraut, salami, yogurt, cheese, traditional pickles, etc).  Note that these are all *live, cultured* foods and the combination of the pH and living culture are important.  Additionally many have added salt which aids preservation too.  Finally I would note that if you make traditional butter, you ferment the cream first and then salt it, and this way the butter will keep more than a few days.  (Edit to clarify:  Many, though not all, of these foods become shelf-stable at higher temperatures after fermentation too.  Examples include cheese, where well-aged cheese can be left out at room temperature without food borne illness risk.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chances are you aren't going to be above those temperatures so that should suffice.  If you are above those temperatures, alcoholic fermentation of fruit is possible and lactic fermentation, while possible, requires a great deal more salt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other concerns:  Yes, you do need to protect from animals and some animals are pretty crafty.  Ravens and racoons, for example, can easily get into all kinds of things.  Both these have been known to get into closed coolers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general you should assume low-grade contamination for food to be reheated.  The question is preventing it from being a problem (cold storage and refridgeration).  I don't see additional risk in being in a closed container well below freezing, but when it thaws, that could change fast.  You need to keep an eye on things." />

It isn't clear what the disposal method is, whether it would be used to produce useful products or just dumped into the earth (again requiring extra energy) and so the disposal portion of the supply chain is a bit of a potential issue too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally there are the complexity costs.  What goes into making the equipment and materials for this reaction?  How much energy goes into them?  What kinds of materials?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typically when people are talking about the technology being clean they are looking at an idealized environment limited to the use of this coal here.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly, note that a number of products of coal combustion are utilized in many other ways.  We get sulfa antibiotics from the waste of certain forms of coal combustion, for example, the same with a lot of modern dyes (in fact sulfa drugs were an off-shoot of coal dye production).  One key element I haven't been able to find information on is what level of re-use of waste products is possible with such a system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless of how clean it is, however, heavy reliance on non-renewable resources is not sustainable." />

If you really wanted to go down this route, it might be worth getting in touch with the closest university with a building-physics group, and asking if they've got student that would like to attempt this as a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A simpler and cruder way to do it, is to wait til it's pretty cold outside (which is right now, if you're in the UK), and about 21&amp;deg;C inside, and then measure the temperature of the glass inside the room. That will allow you to estimate [the central-pane U-value][1] (NB that's only for the glazing - the frames will have a different value)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Next to a **single-glazed window**, the internal surface temperature is around 1°C (**U&gt;5**).&#xD;&#xA; - Next to a **double-glazed window (2000 vintage)**, the surface temperature is around 11°C (**U~3**).&#xD;&#xA; - Next to a **modern, energy-efficient double-glazed window**, the surface temperature is 16°C (**U~1.6**).&#xD;&#xA; - Next to a **well-made modern triple-glazed window**, the temperature is 18°C (**U~0.65**). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(frustatingly, the source I've linked to doesn't say what the outside temperature is supposed to be, for these measurements.

Sewage treatment facilities could be turned into methane factories if we wanted, for example, and the same goes with manure from farms and the like.  Coming up with a sustainable workalike for gasoline is much harder, particularly if we want to use waste products to do it.  For this reason natural gas poses *less of a sustainability problem* than petroleum.  In combination with reduced consumption, this may be a step in the right direction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However it isn't enough by itself to get there.  The US consumes about as much oil as Saudi Arabia produces in each of three areas every year:  agriculture, transportation, and everything else (this means we consume almost as much as the top three oil producing nations make combined).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the technology is more sustainable in the sense that if we use a lot less of it we can probably make sustainable sources of energy work instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think then the key is not that natural gas is more sustainable but rather that it paves the way for some possibilities of more sustainable approaches, but these too must depend on reduced consumption and substituting one fossil fuel for another won't really have any positive impact (the coal will all be burned eventually and so will the oil)." />

One just creates more solid pollution at end of life of the vehicle, the other creates more air pollution.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you noted the EGR makes that your engine runs less efficiently under throttle.  That results in wasted fuel and reduced power.  Meaning you have to consume more fuel to get the power you need.  The lab tests on this show favorable numbers for the EGR valve but in actual use someone driving in town accelerating fast from a stop can actually emit more pollutants.  Under preferred (read low power) acceleration from stop you get great improvement in either case but the EGR vehicle will emit less CO, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under the same amount of throttle, with a barely noticeable reduction in power.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Modern engines including your 2003 Jetta are computer controlled and require an active EGR to operate.  Removing the EGR would require some serious hacking, and performance tuning.  The systems are designed to run optimally with all components operating.  If the EGR is not reporting expected pressures the computer is likely to cause the engine to perform less efficiently.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, there is nothing sustainable about the Jetta.  It runs on a diesel powered Internal combustion engine, requires regular oil changes, and at end of life is a giant pile of fiberglass, plastic, and cheap metal that is not terribly recyclable.  There is quite a bit of aluminum alloy in the frame.  This is less recyclable than steel and often cost prohibitive to re-purpose.  In terms of sustainability the EGR valve is practically irrelevant.

What we can do, is look at some of the factors that influence the pros and cons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Uncertainties within the green electricity tariff&#xD;&#xA;If it was absolutely clear that some of the money you spend on electricity goes to increasing the amount of renewable energy going into the grid, then that would be a big plus. However, it's rarely clear that that is the case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washington State US is in the [WREGIS trading area][1], and that means that a green-energy tariff there is typically based on trading [Renewable Energy Certificates][2] on WREGIS. You'd have to do some digging to find out how much of your tariff premium actually goes to the renewable-energy generators, and how much additional capacity (if any) gets built as a result of that money. The answer there, will make a huge difference to answering your question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And it is about how much new renewable capacity gets built, because generally, renewables have extremely low short-run marginal costs - lower than the wholesale price of electricity - which means that they generate as much as they can anyway, so increasing short-run demand for renewable electricity, does not increase its short-run supply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Propane - useful but filthy and unsustainable&#xD;&#xA;**Propane summary: if your green electricity tariff doesn't get new renewables built, and the marginal electricity generator in your area is coal, then it may be better to stick with propane for now**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Propane is a fossil fuel, and so we know it's a contributor to catastrophic climate change, as well as being a resource that's being depleted unsustainably. So far, so bad. But a switch away is only worth it if it will reduce overall greenhouse-gas emissions. The problem is that if your green electricity tariff results in virtually no extra money going to renewable generators, and thus no additional renewable electricity, then your additional electricity demand from resistance heating or heat pump, will actually get met by fossil generation; and the sustainability impact could be even worse than using propane.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Electrical resistance heating - very low capital impact, potentially high-impact operating impact&#xD;&#xA;**Resistance heating summary: If there's a net sustainability benefit from your green tariff, then electrical resistance heating offers the best contribution toward sustainability (but it will cost you money). Otherwise, it's the worst option**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An electrical resistance heater and storage tank are very cheap to buy, but in operation are very intensive in terms of exergy in to energy out: electricity is a high-quality carrier of energy, whereas the low-grade heat in a hot-water tank is of lower quality - that is to say, there's less exergy per unit energy. To put it another way, getting low grade heat at an efficiency of 90-99% from electricity isn't really very efficient, despite seeming so from those numbers. On the plus side, the materials to make a resistance heater are very simple, so the whole-life sustainability impacts of the equipment, putting aside for one moment the cost of the electricity consumed, are very low.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The net sustainability impact will all depend on what the net result of your green electricity tariff really is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Heat pump - efficient and complicated&#xD;&#xA;**Heat pump summary: This might be the cheapest direct financial cost to you, if the heat pump is good enough; but is unlikely to be the best option from the sustainability angle.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Relative to resistance heating, a heat pump has worse sustainability impact for the equipment up front, and probably on disposal too. Actual real-world performance could give a Seasonal Performance Factor of anywhere between 1 and 5. That's equivalent to an average annual efficiency of 100-500%. The efficiency is influenced by the temperature of your heat source (higher is better), the temperature of your incoming water (higher is better), the temperature you're heating the water to (lower is better), the quality of the installation and equipment, and how well-specified the heat pump is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Looking forward to the Smart Grid&#xD;&#xA;Domestic electricity consumption that has the ability to turn up or down in response to the grid balancer, so-called **Demand-Side Response**, is going to have an economic and sustainability value to the forthcoming Smart Grid. If you've got lots of *storage* hydro on the grid already, then that value will be low. If you haven't, and if grid-balancing at the scale of seconds to minutes is done by fossil fuel, then the value could be high. In this case, electrical heating, and in particular resistance heating, is likely to be one of the better opportunities for Demand-Side Response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Extra options&#xD;&#xA;###Solar thermal&#xD;&#xA;If you've got enough unshaded south-facing surface, then solar thermal could provide a big chunk of your water-heating needs, depending on local climate and your seasonal usage pattern of hot water, in a more sustainable way than any of the other options. (solar thermal works economically in Denmark, and that's at a more northerly latitude than Washington State US - but the Danes do take advantage of the economies of scale).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Community heating&#xD;&#xA;If you live in a high-density built environment, then getting together with your neighbours to set up a community heating scheme is probably the most sustainable option. That would allow you to get heating from a combination of different sources; and you could tune the combination to give the most sustainable outcome.  The combination might feature ground-source or water-source heat pumps, solar thermal, electrical resistance heating, biomass (possibly with CHP), and maybe geothermal too. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Some assumptions I've made, in order to get to some kind of answer&#xD;&#xA; - Your propane (LPG) comes from oil and/or natural gas, with the unsustainability that goes with that&#xD;&#xA; - When you say you're in WA state, that means Washington State in the US, rather than Western Australia or anywhere else. I think your reference to hydro means that Washington is more likely than Western Australia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://wregis.org&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/tracking.htm" />

With that disclaimer in mind though I want to give a very different answer based largely on the work of anthropologist Joseph Tainter (&quot;The Collapse of Complex Socieites&quot;), and look at the relationship between surplus, complexity, and sustainability.  I don't think the relationship is a simple one, and yes there are cases where energy efficiency may make moderate-term sustainability harder to achieve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also think it is necessary to take a long view both of the past and the future in addressing this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tainter's Theories on Complexity and Collapse**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Joseph Tainter has authored a large survey of societal collapse (meaning, as he puts it, simplification), where the number of societal roles decreases radically, as does the coordination between them.  A good example would be the fall of the Western Roman Empire.  The survey is [The Collapse of Complex Societies](http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology/dp/052138673X) and it is well worth reading.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tainter's thesis is that complex societies collapse by simply becoming unsustainably complex, namely that we add complexity to society to solve problems and that at some point we can't keep that going, so major investments required to maintain a current quality of life usually foretell collapse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tainter also directly discusses the impact of energy (in the form of agricultural surplus) in the case of Rome.  During the expansion of Rome, the government was largely fueled by pillaging acculumated surpluses from elsewhere (or more properly proxies for that in the form of gold).  When this could not be continued, Rome had to move from accumulated past surpluses (representing, as he puts it &quot;past solar energy&quot;) to current production (as he puts it &quot;current solar energy&quot;).  This move was catastrophic for the Roman Empire and it lead to a spiral of currency devaluation, and eventually the inability to maintain food production up to the level it needed to be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the points that Tainter brings up is that much of the complexity added was actually there to stall the collapse, and that Rome would have fallen much sooner had they not added the complexity that they did.  However with complexity comes a large sector of the economy which is largely devoted to regulating the rest.  In modern parallels, this would include not only government but also business administration.  The more complex these fields become the fewer people are actually producing and eventually the whole thing collapses.  The level of detail he goes into is astounding and I recommend both watching what lectures he has on Youtube and reading the book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**We Use Energy To Subsidize Complexity**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Prior to the age of fossil fuels, greater social complexity meant that people had to work harder.  The difference between a simple society governed by local self-sufficiency generally and a complex one with large amounts of regulation meant that in the second, people had to work much harder to achieve subsistence.  Historically of course the best example of this is moving from forraging to agriculture (see [The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race by Jarrod Diamond](http://www.scribd.com/doc/2100251/Jared-Diamond-The-Worst-Mistake-in-the-History-of-the-Human-Race)).  In essence the agricultural revolution meant trading quality of life for larger populations and in order to make that work we see additional complexity arise in societies relating to that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same thing applies to the so-called green revolution and the dawn of modern fossil-fuel-based agriculture but with a twist.  In the past humans and animals put forth the effort into tilling the soil, planting, harvesting, etc.  Now the humans and animals are replaced by machines, and the energy comes not from eating grain but from fossil fuels.  Similarly much of the nutrition of the soil comes from fossil fuels instead of decaying organic material, but to build and maintain the machines, associated supply pipelines, etc, many new roles had to arise, and farming came to embody more economic complexity.  This of course was only possible because the energy came from fossil fuels, and this was only possible because of a surplus, at the time, of fossil fuel-based energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Energy Efficiency being good for Sustainability**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the largest challenges sustainability-wise that we have is the fact that we are as dependent on fossil fuels as we are both for energy and for materials (coal, fertilizer, plastic, graphene, and much more).  Additionally demand for energy is increasing faster than supply and for this reason our individual embodied consumption must decrease at least for now.  The larger and more open question of course, is whether being more energy efficient for most of the population just means that their energy consumption can be spread out, where greater energy efficiency of appliances is offset by having more of them (this, itself, may not be a bad thing for reasons below, but it does nullify the effect).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally more energy sources become viable when we become more energy efficient.  It may not be sustainable to run cars on sweetgrass ethanol, but it might be if cars were twice as efficient (perhaps fuel-cell hybrids).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Energy Efficiency being bad for Sustainability**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two significant mechanisms by which increased energy efficiency might lead to unsustainability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first is that we have to be honest, that real solutions to problems require large levels of economic investment and consequently if an economy which is based on ever increasing and unsustainable consumption of consumer products begins to falter, it may be much harder to engage in needed projects, such as grid upgrades necessary to guarantee baseline power from wind, or the like.  Having more sustainable products doesn't matter of people can't pay for them, and so the simplification of consumption which is needed to achieve sustainability also can thwart that same goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second is that if we succeed in freeing up surplus energy we will, as history shows, want to use that energy to solve our problems and therefore the shift will be made from using it in ways which are necessary for human life and towards a regulatory role.  This can add to non-productive complexity and make it harder to solve the next challenges down the road.  For example, we could see an actual consumption drop in energy lead to an increase in energy consumption in businesses who then use that energy to subsidize complexity of their own operations, or the same for government.  The same goes for moving towards higher levels of technology, where greater complexity goes into engineering, manufacturing, and maintenance when compared to relatively simple technologies.  Each of these tasks takes energy and consequently, we become far more dependent on energy efficiency and less able to make investments in solving future problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have already pointed to a book written largely on this topic.  I am sure many more could be." />

Farm monocultures for example can only be maintained with (artificial) fertilizers and often pesticides are also used. &#xD;&#xA;Third, localisation reduces the power of multinational companies and a lot of multinationals have very poor track records when it comes to sustainability (e.g. Shell, Chevron, Dow Chemicals, Cargill). &#xD;&#xA;Finally, although not directly related to sustainability, food that is produced in bulk is usually processed and then stored in warehouses for years before it is being consumed. This means that the quality of the food is much less than that of food produced locally and consumed quickly after harvesting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this being said, some of the advantages I mentioned need not necesarilly apply. For example, some crops only grow in countries with a warm climate all year round. To only way to have those crops available in countries with a colder climate is to grow them in greenhouses. Greenhouses use gas or electricity for heating which leads to higher CO2 emissions than when transporting those crops from warmer countries (provided transportation is done by truck and/or boat, see also [this question](http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/92/99)). Also a local farmer can still use a lot of pesticides and artificial fertilizers to grow crops when trying to increase his production.&#xD;&#xA;Some people also claim that localization requires more land to produce the same amount of food and products, but the debate on this point is still ongoing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you also count 'social sustainability', localising the economy will mean that people in poor countries do not have access to markets in rich countries so it may be harder for them to earn money. On the other hand, infant industries in poor countries will not be put out of business by large global companies and in local economies there are much less corporate 'middlemen' who do nothing more than drive up prices. &#xD;&#xA;" />

Localising the economy will typically require more inputs for a given set of outputs, and higher inputs means lower sustainability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, it requires much lower inputs to grow fruit in the tropics and ship it to Iceland, that to grow fruit in Iceland.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shipping is a remarkably low-input way to move things around, and a lot of work is underway to lessen its unsustainability. Road transport over the last few tens of miles is far more costly than shipping over a few thousand kilometres.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We've known for a couple of centuries now, since the work of David Ricardo, that free international trade allows for national specialisations, meaning that countries that can produce the same goods for lower inputs, will do so, and export to other countries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More recently, in the last 12 years, Gregor Czisch and others established that the lowest-cost and lowest-input way to provide sustainabile electricity was by hugely increasing the capacity of international electricity connectors (interconnectors): up to pretty high levels, the larger the interconnectors, and the larger the international electricity trade, the easier it is to get to a sustainable electricity supply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that internationalisation in and of itself is beneficial: it is **necessary**, but not **sufficient**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When there are unpriced externalities in transport, then it is very difficult to establish what a sustainable level of international trade is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the big problems with localisation is that it requires low-density land-use, so that settlements have local supplies of food and water.  However, low-density land-use makes most transport unsustainable: high-density cities with remote high-intensity farm and water supplies are far more sustainable than the equivalent population in rural settlements, because of the relative land-take and energy inputs needed for the transportation of people and goods." />

This makes it very difficult for breweries to have deals with restaurants regarding bottle reuse, because the distributors must be the broker both ways, and currently they are only the brokers in one direction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think these are insurmountable but it means tackling a lot of very dear aspects of American consumption and economic culture to make it happen, I am afraid." />

With that disclaimer in mind though I want to give a very different answer based largely on the work of anthropologist Joseph Tainter (&quot;The Collapse of Complex Socieites&quot;), and look at the relationship between surplus, complexity, and sustainability.  I don't think the relationship is a simple one, and yes there are cases where energy efficiency may make moderate-term sustainability harder to achieve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also think it is necessary to take a long view both of the past and the future in addressing this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tainter's Theories on Complexity and Collapse**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Joseph Tainter has authored a large survey of societal collapse (meaning, as he puts it, simplification), where the number of societal roles decreases radically, as does the coordination between them.  A good example would be the fall of the Western Roman Empire.  The survey is [The Collapse of Complex Societies](http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology/dp/052138673X) and it is well worth reading.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tainter's thesis is that complex societies collapse by simply becoming unsustainably complex, namely that we add complexity to society to solve problems and that at some point we can't keep that going, so major investments required to maintain a current quality of life usually foretell collapse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tainter also directly discusses the impact of energy (in the form of agricultural surplus) in the case of Rome.  During the expansion of Rome, the government was largely fueled by pillaging acculumated surpluses from elsewhere (or more properly proxies for that in the form of gold).  When this could not be continued, Rome had to move from accumulated past surpluses (representing, as he puts it &quot;past solar energy&quot;) to current production (as he puts it &quot;current solar energy&quot;).  This move was catastrophic for the Roman Empire and it lead to a spiral of currency devaluation, and eventually the inability to maintain food production up to the level it needed to be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the points that Tainter brings up is that much of the complexity added was actually there to stall the collapse, and that Rome would have fallen much sooner had they not added the complexity that they did.  However with complexity comes a large sector of the economy which is largely devoted to regulating the rest.  In modern parallels, this would include not only government but also business administration.  The more complex these fields become the fewer people are actually producing and eventually the whole thing collapses.  The level of detail he goes into is astounding and I recommend both watching what lectures he has on Youtube and reading the book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**We Use Energy To Subsidize Complexity**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Prior to the age of fossil fuels, greater social complexity meant that people had to work harder.  The difference between a simple society governed by local self-sufficiency generally and a complex one with large amounts of regulation meant that in the second, people had to work much harder to achieve subsistence.  Historically of course the best example of this is moving from forraging to agriculture (see [The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race by Jarrod Diamond](http://www.scribd.com/doc/2100251/Jared-Diamond-The-Worst-Mistake-in-the-History-of-the-Human-Race)).  In essence the agricultural revolution meant trading quality of life for larger populations and in order to make that work we see additional complexity arise in societies relating to that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same thing applies to the so-called green revolution and the dawn of modern fossil-fuel-based agriculture but with a twist.  In the past humans and animals put forth the effort into tilling the soil, planting, harvesting, etc.  Now the humans and animals are replaced by machines, and the energy comes not from eating grain but from fossil fuels.  Similarly much of the nutrition of the soil comes from fossil fuels instead of decaying organic material, but to build and maintain the machines, associated supply pipelines, etc, many new roles had to arise, and farming came to embody more economic complexity.  This of course was only possible because the energy came from fossil fuels, and this was only possible because of a surplus, at the time, of fossil fuel-based energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Energy Efficiency being good for Sustainability**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the largest challenges sustainability-wise that we have is the fact that we are as dependent on fossil fuels as we are both for energy and for materials (coal, fertilizer, plastic, graphene, and much more).  Additionally demand for energy is increasing faster than supply and for this reason our individual embodied consumption must decrease at least for now.  The larger and more open question of course, is whether being more energy efficient for most of the population just means that their energy consumption can be spread out, where greater energy efficiency of appliances is offset by having more of them (this, itself, may not be a bad thing for reasons below, but it does nullify the effect).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally more energy sources become viable when we become more energy efficient.  It may not be sustainable to run cars on sweetgrass ethanol, but it might be if cars were twice as efficient (perhaps fuel-cell hybrids).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Energy Efficiency being bad for Sustainability**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two significant mechanisms by which increased energy efficiency might lead to unsustainability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first is that we have to be honest, that real solutions to problems require large levels of economic investment and consequently if an economy which is based on ever increasing and unsustainable consumption of consumer products begins to falter, it may be much harder to engage in needed projects, such as grid upgrades necessary to guarantee baseline power from wind, or the like.  Having more sustainable products doesn't matter of people can't pay for them, and so the simplification of consumption which is needed to achieve sustainability also can thwart that same goal.  For example if electricity consumption drops, it is harder to justify investment into wind-based power generation and the grid upgrades necessary to make that happen.00&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second is that if we succeed in freeing up surplus energy we will, as history shows, want to use that energy to solve our problems and therefore the shift will be made from using it in ways which are necessary for human life and towards a regulatory role.  This can add to non-productive complexity and make it harder to solve the next challenges down the road.  For example, we could see an actual consumption drop in energy lead to an increase in energy consumption in businesses who then use that energy to subsidize complexity of their own operations, or the same for government.  The same goes for moving towards higher levels of technology, where greater complexity goes into engineering, manufacturing, and maintenance when compared to relatively simple technologies.  Each of these tasks takes energy and consequently, we become far more dependent on energy efficiency and less able to make investments in solving future problems. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have already pointed to a book written largely on this topic.  I am sure many more could be." />

The Irish Potato Famine occurred because everyone was growing the same high yield strains of potatoes, because other crops were out of reach of the Irish peasants.  While this was a very energy efficient solution, it wasn't sustainable.  Therefore one of the concerns regarding sustainability needs to be robustness and this is where diversity comes in and mitigation of risks even if this comes with the loss of efficiency, at least if we define sustainability not to include massive famines or the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Diversity is the key mitigation strategy and it has two important components.  First, highly diverse systems help control pests the way we currently use pesticides (this is a key strategy of permaculture for pest control btw).  Secondly they limit damage because species-specific pests have greater trouble spreading.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second important issue has to do with evolutionary ecology.  One of the key things to note is that ecological niches are not static but in fact change as environmental factors change.  Let's look at gypsy moths for example.  During an outbreak of these pests one thing that is observed is that predators specialize in ways they wouldn't before.  Animals that might eat gypsy moths in all stages may go for what they might find easier to catch, whether it is the actual moths (possibly bats), the caterpillers (some birds), or the like.  As the outbreak subsides, many of these will actually re-generalize.  Diversity of predators thus provides layers of protection in the case of pest outbreaks." />

If you compare a small bakery to a large bread factory, there are some optimizations that can happen with the latter that can't happen with the former (for starters, the ovens, by virtue of being larger, will have higher volume to surface area ratios and this reduces accidental energy loss).  Similarly centralized transportation requires less inputs than decentralized transportation.  The farmer who takes 500lbs of produce in his pickup truck 200 miles to sell at a farmer's market uses up a lot of fossil fuels compared to what would happen if things were shipped in larger quantity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taken to its extreme I think one might be tempted to say that Walmart is good from a sustainability perspective because it saves us from farmer's markets and local bakeries.  The problem is though this optimizes (and optimizes badly, I might add) for only one factor and thus, in my view runs the wrong way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Before I say why I think that runs the wrong point it is worth saying that a lot of things *cant* be localized.  Many of the higher technology components, like solar cells, really do require a certain economy of scale even to hit break-even points energy-wise.  For this reason I don't think that things go all one way.  This being said, I think sustainability requires to some extent decentralizing the economy from where we are today.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Localization and Agriculture**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our current system of food production, distribution, and processing is very energy-intensive.  The [majority of this is in indirect costs](http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf), such as pesticides and fertilizers.  The massive use of fossil fuels allows modern large-scale farming techniques and there is no current substitute which allows downsizing our nation's farms without the large input of fossil fuels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's worth noting that the congressional report cited above notes that the majority of energy consumed in the production of most crops is in the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides, not the use of diesel to plow land, harvest, etc.  Cutting down on fossil fuels in agriculture thus means abandoning large-scale mechanized farming of hundreds of acres and a move towards smaller scale, where concerns over soil fertility, pest control, etc can be managed through biodiversity.  Thus liquid biomass fuels don't really even approach a solution for agriculture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The primary contenders to solve this problem both require downsizing farms and replacing cheap fossil fuel inputs with more expensive human inputs.  These include smaller scale organic farming (note that draft animals are [making a comeback](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-12-farming-horses_x.htm) as a reaction to high fuel prices.  Organic farming by draft animal potentially gets rid of the vast majority of fossil fuel inputs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other possibility is permaculture, which tries to harness natural dynamics between species for support of plants and control of disease.  Permaculture is small-scale, however, and while it is high yield at low inputs, most of the human-directed inputs are directly human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't see any possibility of achieving sustainability without decentralizing farming.  This means a shift of inputs from fossil fuels to people and animals.  That has a lot of implications regarding lifestyles, and a need to significantly downsize energy consumption in order to make that happen (more people working in agriculture, fewer in energy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Localization and Energy**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some materials in this area do not work well from a standpoint of localization and so manufacturing and distribution of these may not be able to be localized.  However, I think that there are still very important benefits from thinking about the problems in terms of localization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first is that the most promising technology to replace fossil fuels for electricity generation is wind power, at least given current EROI figures.  Wind has a [very good EROI](http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_return_on_investment_%28EROI%29_for_wind_energy).  The real challenge is that wind is fickle and unreliable, and so it is hard to generate baseline energy over a small area.  One solution for this to have large numbers of geographically dispersed wind farms but this requires a power grid designed for a level of what might be described as &quot;chaos&quot; that they are not designed for today (where things are based on large, reasonably dependable power plants serving specific areas).  Thinking in terms of localized production, done well, is an important aspect I think to more distributed energy production (and Wind requires thinking about energy production in a distributed manner).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second point is that there have been [installations](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/03/29/cargill-adds-second-dairy-farm-methane-to-power-digester/) of methane digesters at commercial dairy farms.  Whether CAFO-modelled dairy farms may not be sustainable, the idea of smaller scale, local energy production off of material that would otherwise be discarded is very positive development sustainability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Localization and Waste Management**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The final area where I think that is important to consider here is the idea of local material cycles.  Our current approach can be described as &quot;factory to landfill&quot; and the problem with this is that recycling becomes somewhat problematic and requires heavy centralization.  While some areas of recycling can be centralized, things like organic material are harder to do so.  We can't exactly ship sewage or compost effectively over the railway system and so the ability to take waste products and turn them into useful products is reduced by over-centralization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Waste management is closely tied to energy and agriculture however.  New York City is [moving towards](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/science/09sewage.html?_r=0) harvesting methane from sewage treatment for electrical power, and they are not alone.   Some forms of fertilizer come out of wastewater treatment and there are many other products which can be seen as locally produced in this way as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Robustness vs Efficiency**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With modern agriculture and global distribution of food, we still see famines as a result of civil war and other factors, where disruption of distribution, in the distribution network leads to catastrophic human costs.  There are major issues here including the over-centralization of agriculture globally and this raises very significant social and economic sustainability concerns.  Overreliance on long-distance trade raises concerns about robustness.  This means that overcentralization trades efficiency for a lack of robustness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, I think decentralization, re-ruralization, and localization, compared to where we are today, are necessary for attaining sustainability.  This does not mean however, that everything can be decentralized.  Some things may require greater economies of scale to be viable.  However our centralization today is heavily subsidized by fossil fuels and to kick that dependency one must move somewhat in the other direction.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Whether this is worthwhile depends on available means of cooling. Water cooling works very well but is not usually practical, and air cooling is a possibly but liable to be pursued only by the &quot;excessively enthused&quot; :-). With the present low and falling cost of PV panels, just buying one more is usually more economical than trying to get more power out of a given number of panels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;______________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to note that available energy is related to light level and that cloudy or end of day outputs will be well down on peak outputs. While this sounds obvious, numerous solar product makers do not make this clear. THE most important requirement is a clear line of sight between the panel surface and the sun (or brightest spot in sky). On a full sun day, if direct sunlight does not fall on the panel the out[ut will be under 10% in most cases and perhaps as high as 20% if an exceptionally good reflective  path is available. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A very bright cloudy day such that the sun location cannot be determined but the cloud is so bright as to hurt your eyes will give perhaps 20% - 30% of full output. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sunlight through a window will give perhaps 80% of full output **IF** direct sunlight falls on the whole panel surface. Otherwise output will be poor, as above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In low insolation areas (which would include the UK) it is vital that panels are mounted  at the correct elevation angle, and changing this a few times per year will give you slightly better output. This is well covered on the internet. One excellent site is www.gaisma.com with [London data](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/london.html) and [All UK locations](http://www.gaisma.com/en/dir/gb-country.html) as examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The diagram below from Gaisma's [London](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/london.html) page show the path of the sun with time during a day at midsummer (green), midwinter (blue) and now (1 March, blue). Midday sun angle from horizontal is 60 degrees in midsummer, about 15 degrees !!! in midwinter and about 30 degrees at present. What angle you set your panels to depends on whether you can alter the angle  occasionally throughout the year or intend to leave them at a fixed angle. Fixed optimum angle depends on whether you want maximum energy overall or maximum winter output or some other choice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SHrPS.png" />

Higher efficiency cells usually command a price premium - which is only of benefit to the user if available space is limited and you want as much power as possible within a given area. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PC are up to about 15% efficient and   &#xD;&#xA;MC up to about 18%.   &#xD;&#xA;SunPower make &quot;rear contact&quot; MC cells that have the current collection wires on the rear surface and also have optimisations aimed at reducing reflections (which otherwise reduce available light) and dealing with off angle light slightly better than usual - all of which adds up to give about 23% efficiency in commercially available cells -  but cost per Watt is higher and they will generally not be the best option in &quot;normal&quot; applications. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Modest gains can be achieved by edging your panels with low cost reflectors to achieve a very modest degree of concentration. 10% - 20% extra power is &quot;not too hard [tm] to achieve this way. [3M make a reflective film specifically aimed at this application]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While it is very seldom mentioned or used, modest but useful gains in output can be achieved by cooling the panel somewhat. Whether this is worthwhile depends on available means of cooling. Water cooling works very well but is not usually practical, and air cooling is a possibly but liable to be pursued only by the &quot;excessively enthused&quot; :-). With the present low and falling cost of PV panels, just buying one more is usually more economical than trying to get more power out of a given number of panels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;______________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to note that available energy is related to light level and that cloudy or end of day outputs will be well down on peak outputs. While this sounds obvious, numerous solar product makers do not make this clear. THE most important requirement is a clear line of sight between the panel surface and the sun (or brightest spot in sky). On a full sun day, if direct sunlight does not fall on the panel the out[ut will be under 10% in most cases and perhaps as high as 20% if an exceptionally good reflective  path is available. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A very bright cloudy day such that the sun location cannot be determined but the cloud is so bright as to hurt your eyes will give perhaps 20% - 30% of full output. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sunlight through a window will give perhaps 80% of full output **IF** direct sunlight falls on the whole panel surface. Otherwise output will be poor, as above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In low insolation areas (which would include the UK) it is vital that panels are mounted  at the correct elevation angle, and changing this a few times per year will give you slightly better output. This is well covered on the internet. One excellent site is www.gaisma.com with [**London data**](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/london.html) and [**All UK locations**](http://www.gaisma.com/en/dir/gb-country.html) as examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The diagram below from Gaisma's [**London**](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/london.html) **page** show the path of the sun with time during a day at midsummer (green), midwinter (blue) and now (early March, blue). Midday sun angle from horizontal is 60 degrees in midsummer, about 15 degrees !!! in midwinter and about 30 degrees at present. What angle you set your panels to depends on whether you can alter the angle  occasionally throughout the year or intend to leave them at a fixed angle. Fixed optimum angle depends on whether you want maximum energy overall or maximum winter output or some other choice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SHrPS.png" />

Here a some suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Wash clothes in cold water only.&#xD;&#xA; - Turn your freezer/refrigerator up a few degrees.&#xD;&#xA; - Purchase insulated curtains/shades, and close them during the day when you are at work.  &#xD;&#xA; - Make sure your furniture is arranged so that it is not blocking any vents or radiators.&#xD;&#xA; - Purchase a draft guard to place at the bottom of your door leading to the outside where temperature-controlled air can escape from your apartment.&#xD;&#xA; - Install a low flow shower water head.  Shower head screw on/off easily.  Keep the old head to replace when/if you move.&#xD;&#xA; - Clean Your Refrigerator: It's unlikely that you'll purchase new&#xD;&#xA;   energy efficient appliances for your rental, but you can tweak the&#xD;&#xA;   ones you already have. For example, by cleaning the coils on the back&#xD;&#xA;   of your fridge you'll help one of the biggest energy hogging&#xD;&#xA;   appliances run more efficiently.&#xD;&#xA; - Use Energy Efficient Bulbs, even if you're put off by the slightly&#xD;&#xA;   higher upfront cost, you can simply unscrew them and take them with&#xD;&#xA;   you when it's time to move.&#xD;&#xA; - Use Power Strips: A lot of energy is wasted through electronics left&#xD;&#xA;   plugged in, and the resulting vampire energy. Put a stop to it by&#xD;&#xA;   using one of a number of cool, smart energy strips, which will turn&#xD;&#xA;   off vampire energy when the electronics are not in use.&#xD;&#xA; - Use a Humidifier &amp; Lower Your Heat: Keeping humidity levels up during&#xD;&#xA;   the winter is not only good for your health, but also for your air&#xD;&#xA;   and furniture. It also helps keep the ambient air temperature feeling&#xD;&#xA;   warmer than dry air, which means you can turn your thermostat down.&#xD;&#xA;   If your HVAC system doesn't have a humidifier built-in, then you can&#xD;&#xA;   get an inexpensive and portable humidifier to use during dry&#xD;&#xA;   conditions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

And they are much easier to decarbonise than fossil cars - they just need renewable electricity to recharge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in general, yes, electic cars are a significant improvement over their fossil-fuel guzzling competitors.  (And it's rather bizarre to hope that the batteries end up at a landfill after just 3 years of life.  But if that were the case, no, that would not be remotely sustainable.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of their advantages over petrol (gasoline) &amp; diesel, it will depend on just how your electricity is generated, and what the full lifecycle costs are of each vehicle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Presently, at least here in the UK, a lot of electric-car suppliers are leasing, rather than selling, the batteries, which means that they'll go back to the manufacturer at the end of their life for complete recycling. After all, a dead battery contains all the ingredients needed to make a brand-new battery - the thing that needs doing, is reversing all the decay chemistry, which is just a question of energy inputs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I wrote [over on skeptics.SE][9]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Electric cars are about 4x as efficient as fossil-fuelled combustion engines, tank-to-wheel: [ICE engine efficiency][1] is around 20%. Electric engines tend to be [around 80-90%][2].

Other perspectives of course are welcome and the whole purpose is to provide public insight into what's on and off topic here so please vote on these.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problems @Pitt noted above are design issues with well understood solutions, which include biodiversity for starters (so that removing part of one species enables fallback on others).  The larger barrier of course is knowledge.  Permaculture involves working smarter rather than harder, and so reducing the overall energy inputs.  This means humans have to do most stuff, you can't leave it to machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that permaculture is an important aspect of any attempt to become sustainable because it is sustainable itself, because we must mimic natural ecosystems in our own approaches to material and waste management, and because it cultivates interconnected and sustainable communities on all levels.  This is not to say that there aren't challenges regarding human inputs and knowledge levels, and that these may have impacts elsewhere.  On the whole, I think that widespread permaculture is a good thing however.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Permaculture is Sustainable Itself**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Permaculture is sustainable with few external inputs.  Permaculture utilizes processes of evolutionary ecology to replace most of the external direct energy inputs aside from the sun, as well as all indirect inputs beyond the initial design and implementation phase.  This largely cuts fossil fuels out of the system of food production.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Permaculture utilizes carefully chosen plants and domestic animals, as well as sometimes wildlife, for pest control.  For example one might plant thorny hedges to keep deer out of the food production area, while providing habitat for birds of prey so that that they can prevent rodents from becoming a problem.  Pests an never be entirely eliminated because predators always lag behind pests, but in this way they can be controlled so that they do not cause substantial damage in established permacultures.  A good beginner's book on this subject is [Gaia's Garden](http://www.amazon.com/Gaias-Garden-Second-Home-Scale-Permaculture/dp/1603580298).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second point is that species are arranged in ways which mutually support eachother.  I haven't been able to experiment with this but a example of an area where this might be helpful might be co-raising cattle and horses, together in an area that has snow so as to minimize the need for hay.  Cattle won't eat what they can't see so they tend to starve quickly when it snows, but horses will kick the snow away to eat.  Thus the horses can be used to help the cattle forage in winter.  If areas are maintained with sufficient forage, hay may not even be necessary (there are recorded cases of cowboys with herds stuck in winter storms following mustang herds in order to ensure the cattle could eat, and thus saving their herds).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The Necessity for Material Lifecycles to Mimic Ecosystems**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an ecosystem, the waste product of one species or element becomes the input of another.  Bears poop in the woods.  Micro-organisms break down the poop and they release waste products which plants take in.  Those plants may produce fruit and the bears eat the fruit.  The bears then poop and the cycle repeats.  This example shows the way in which nutrient cycles work in ecosystems, re-using and re-cycling all components and over time building quality soils and very efficient ways of transforming current solar energy into biological energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sustainability requires, among other things, that we stop polluting our environment with things which cannot readily be re-used in the biological context.  For this reason it is very important to develop closed material lifecycles.  Our current factory-to-landfill must eventually be replaced with a closed cycle where very little if anything ends up in land fills because everything is re-used in some context or another.  Doing this requires in essence having the output or waste of one system becoming the input of another.  Recycling is one way this can happen (re-use is another), but either way waste must be re-purposed as an asset.  An example might be privatizing sewage treatment, not as a waste disposal service, but as a series of cooking gas and fertilizer factories.  Waste products which cannot be recycled can be re-used in unexpected ways, such as building things out of &quot;urbanite.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The shift in thinking from a factory to landfill pipeline to a series of interconnected and infinitely continuous series of material lifecycles (akin to the water cycle, or to nutrient cycles in ecosystems), is absolutely necessary to achieving sustainability, and permaculture teaches this quite a bit.  This is a reason why I am such of a fan of urban permaculture.  While the idea of feeding a family of 4 on a city lot is probably unrealistic, the lessons learned about sustainability and the increase in free time from doing so (instead of high maintenance flower gardens!) is well worth it.  Most of my &quot;flower gardens&quot; also produce fruits and veggies, they look nice, and they require very, very little maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sustainable Communities**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The emphasis on the output of one component being the input of another has the potential at least to build close-knit, sustainable communities through garden exchanges, and also things like thinking about what one can re-use things that would otherwise be discarded.  Urbanite as a building material for small projects (say outdoor pizza ovens) comes to mind but the possibilities here are really endless.  The more we think about what we can do with waste, the less of it ends up being discarded in unsustainable ways and the closer we become as communities as we utilize the waste products of neighbors and vice versa,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sustainability Challenges**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The big one actually is manpower (and this is an issue for most green energy too btw but for very different reasons), and the second is education.  Building permacultures requires years of practice and/or significant training.  It also turns food production into an intellectually challenging activity.  However it is also less physically challenging than conventional agriculture in many cases, and so there are possibilities of closing loops here.  The problem with manpower though is not so easily overlooked.  With modern fossil-fuel-based agriculture it is not hard for an individual to successfully farm vast tracts of land, possibly in the hundreds of acres, with only seasonal help.  Permaculture requires more *people* to be working in food production.  It also requires that people make more careful choices regarding foods to consume (grains are less sustainable than chestnuts for example, and wheat is less sustainable than rice).  More people in &quot;farming&quot; full-time means fewer people engineering green energy solutions and the like.  Competition for manpower is thus a significant concern as I see it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see permaculture as pretty close to a necessity for achieving sustainability both due to its direct effects and also its indirect effects.  I also see permaculture ultimately as the best current training ground for the sorts of patterns we must develop in order to achieve sustainability generally." />

In New Zealand, our plastic is picked up by diesel trucks, and with various intermediate steps, is later shipped to China where it's recycled. Glass is ground up and used as road aggregate, which may even be worse than just piling it up somewhere (we could at least use it for glass later that way).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm in a household of 3, and we tend to fill a rubbish bag about every 2 weeks. We go one step further than the above, and bury our meat scraps (which are not compostable in your average composting system). Things that tend to fill it up are polystyrene foam, used tissues, and plastic packaging. Reducing purchases of products containing those things will be our next step.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, my philosophy is that it's more important to be a positive example to others (to change what's normal) than it is to become an extremist myself. If I lived in a monastery somewhere living off the land, I might be 100% sustainable, but I wouldn't be mixing with others to set a visible example. That's why I'm on an unsustainable computer right now writing this post instead of using the time walking to a special store that will sell me some food without packaging." />

I think that there are a few that need to weigh in a little bit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The biggest one is access to either of these types of stores to buy the products. For me, IKEA is a two hour drive each way. I could get to a Target or Walmart in 15-20 minutes, so it would probably be better to get self-assembly furniture there instead and save the longer trip.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Likewise, buying used can be even closer to home, especially if you are buying second hand from others. However, in terms of driving time, you likely will buy from a diverse group of people to get all the furniture you need, which could mean lots of individual trips, versus one trip to get the self-assembly furniture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in terms of initial purchase time and driving time, this could learn more towards self-assembly in my book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - - - - - - &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second step is then the actual moving. Again there are two options, sell or ship. For shorter moves, I would guess that it is better to just move the furniture versus again driving all over town to get &quot;new&quot; furniture (really just different if you are buying used :) ).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of selling your furniture, I would guess that there is a decent disparity between the price that you can get for a piece of self-assembly furniture v. a used piece of quality furniture. In my experience, self-assembly furniture is at least half price what you would pay in store if buying used. Standard furniture you can seomtimes sell for as much or more than you bought it used. (This is probably more the disparity between new and used than a direct relation to quality. Also it is far easier to look up the price of an IKEA piece of furniture than other used furniture, so the &quot;new&quot; price is more known.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not that price is the ultimate decider in terms of sustainability, but I find that it has a definite influence on the ability to accept a green practice. When someone knows that they will be hard pressed to recover the cost of a product and deem it fairly cheap to begin with, it is more likely to be thrown away than sold or shipped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - - - - - &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately, my primary consideration (having moved 3 times in the past year), is the ability to pack around the furniture. I had some furniture from IKEA that we disassembled and moved around. I also had some used furniture that I packed. I also had some furniture of both that was either seriously worn or cumbersome to move, so we donated that to a local thrift store.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you plan to be moving often, I would want to limit the number of moving trucks and I think that this can be done with either type of furniture as long as you are willing to pack in around the furniture (which may depend on the moving company more than anything). We did a U-Haul, so we were able to pack it full and move it well. " />

I can't seem to find a good resource at this time that breaks it out conclusively but the logic that I have heard go as follows.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Composting happens at different speeds and different heat levels. Your typical worm bin tends to operate at a low temperature (otherwise the worms would bake!). This would be slower normally, but the worms speed up the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the overall heat increases (usually as a result of the proper mix of materials and frequent turning), the speed of the material breakdown increases. (For example a commercial system like this - http://www.hotrotsolutions.com/ - can yield compost in as little as 10-14 days according to their site.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, you need a hotter, more active system to really breakdown a lot of biodegradable plastics. Not that they won't eventually break down in your regular compost systems, but they likely won't break down as quickly as the other materials, leaving plastic pieces mixed in the compost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other consideration would be whether this adds any value to the worms. I have found vermicomposting to be like raising a pet, allows having to make sure that they have the right amount of food and water. Much of the material that you put in the system breaks down quickly because the worms are either eating it or using it as bedding. I guess that the plastic could be a form of bedding (this is pure speculation) but because I would assume that it would break down much slower than the newspaper that it more commonly used, it is likely to end up gumming up your system." />

You didn't need someone to transport the bucket to a recycling facility, transport those raw materials from the recycling process to a new manufacturer, incur the energy costs of manufacturing from the raw materials, and then the transport of the new bucket (or pot) back to a store for you to buy.

Without the holes, you could still use them as watering cans or rainwater catchment, just to come up with a few gardening related ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The entire premise here being that you are diminishing the overall value of the bucket by poking holes in it. In that way you are getting it closer to the point where recycling is the only option, since it won't work for a variety of other uses. In some ways this is inevitable, since pretty much everything wears out eventually and needs to be cycled as sustainably as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only recommendation would be to consider if there are intermediate uses for the buckets in between the restaurant use and your use as a garden pot. If you can use them for something and then as they get worn, use fresh buckets from the restaurant for that task and poke holes in the old buckets for pots, I would figure that would be a more sustainable cycle.

Finally the foods we normally prefer to eat are of questionable sustainability.  Our culture sees home gardening as a hobby and something which provides at best a small supplement to commercially grown foods.  This means if you start growing cabbages and tomatoes in your front yard, neighbors may complain, and there have been people fined for zoning law violations for growing too many vegetables in their city lots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are, of course, alternatives which can match the constraints but understanding the constraints are necessary first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I want to also expand on the question of sustainability of current preferences regarding vegetables.  We mostly eat annuals in this role, and they mostly fall into the ecological role of &quot;pioneer species&quot; in fertile areas, which prefer to grow on disturbed fertile soil, and help prepare the soil for the next wave of plants.  However, perpetually disturbing the soil has significant costs fertility-wise which is why chemical fertilizers (usually made from fossil fuels) are necessary.  This isn't to say we should abandon lettuce, tomatoes, and cabbage, but it is to say that we may want to be more careful about where and how much of these we grow and consume.  Alternative, perennial vegetables are more sustainable when grown right and they deserve much more space than we give them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Western culture *used to* eat a fair number of perennial veggies (and we still eat a few like asparagus) but these have frequently fallen by the wayside, which is a shame sustainability-wise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Usefulness in Sustainability**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I totally agree that done right, urban food production is an important aspect of sustainability.  It is unlikely to mean that cities are self-sufficient, food-wise, but it does mean that fewer energy inputs are required because less food has to move at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in addition I am in particular a fan of urban *permaculture* because this provides higher yields with fewer inputs, and it provides general sustainability training of a sort that is otherwise quite irreplaceable (see my proposed answer to the connection of permaculture and sustainability).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Historical Interlude:  Victory Gardens**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In WWII, one interesting aspect of the war effort was the promotion of victory gardens by the White House as a matter of easing pressure on domestic food sources brought on both by the war effort and the internment of Japanese-American farmers.   By the end of the war it was estimated that around half of the produce grown in the United States was grown in private lots and city parks.  So while this does not necessarily lead to self-sufficiency regarding food in cities, it certainly helps reduce the burdens on transportation and fossil-fueled agribusiness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Some thoughts on urban permaculture**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One aspect of my own gardens at the house in Chelan, WA is that a lot of garden space is actually multi-purposed.  I have many flowers which produce edible tubers, or are useful in herbal medicine, or even produce edible fruit.  I intend to extend my &quot;flower gardens&quot; to include blueberry patches, and I can already go most of the summer without buying fruit (ornamental plums, freestone peaches, grapes, strawberries, blackberries).  The gardens themselves utilize very few inputs and many don't even get weeded more than once a year if that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However you can't look at the flower gardens from a distance and see that they are anything other than ornamental.  The gardens look like flower gardens which keeps many neighbors happy and there are some small vegetable gardens (and I also add container gardens) in places where they are helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of the use as you say is trying to use &quot;all my yard&quot; for something.

The pump is not intended to have a very high &quot;head&quot; or lift distance above floor level, but must have enough pressure to piump water above the level of a wash-tub as this is usually what is used as the water drain. Such pumps will be able to pump water &quot;somewhat higher&quot;. Flow rate will drop with increasing height, but a tank mounted slightly above toilet tank level will be able to be filled. From there it is &quot;easy enough&quot; to take a pipe to the toilet water inlet.  If desired you could use an independent inlet with its own valve so the mains feed is left in place with the tap turned off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that washing machine water will contain soap scum and dirt from clothes, which is liable to build up in storage tank, cistern and vales and pipe and need occasional cleaning. Filtering, settling and careful positioning of the toilet feed pipe ebtry will minimise this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A small electric pump could be used to transfer water from a lower level tank or a handpump could be used. You may wish to figure pump and pumping costs into your calculations if you want to know how &quot;green&quot; your solution is overall. In my country (New Zealand) the water for a toilet cistern fill costs about 3 cents and the electricity required to lift this one meter (assuming a fairly inefficient system) costs about 0.01 cents, so the reuse costs about 300 times less. Electric pumps can come from windscreen washer pumps (good lift, low rate, more easily blocked, usually 12V operation), electric washing machine pumps (fairly ideal: mains powered, OK lift, find in junk-yard) and more. Only some washing machine pumps are electrically powered - older ones tend to use mechanical drive using the main motor. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Other perspectives of course are welcome and the whole purpose is to provide public insight into what's on and off topic here so please vote on these.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problems @Pitt noted above are design issues with well understood solutions, which include biodiversity for starters (so that removing part of one species enables fallback on others).  The larger barrier of course is knowledge.  Permaculture involves working smarter rather than harder, and so reducing the overall energy inputs.  This means humans have to do most stuff, you can't leave it to machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that permaculture is an important aspect of any attempt to become sustainable because it is sustainable itself, because we must mimic natural ecosystems in our own approaches to material and waste management, and because it cultivates interconnected and sustainable communities on all levels.  This is not to say that there aren't challenges regarding human inputs and knowledge levels, and that these may have impacts elsewhere.  On the whole, I think that widespread permaculture is a good thing however.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Permaculture is Sustainable Itself**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Permaculture is sustainable with few external inputs.  Permaculture utilizes processes of evolutionary ecology to replace most of the external direct energy inputs aside from the sun, as well as all indirect inputs beyond the initial design and implementation phase.  This largely cuts fossil fuels out of the system of food production.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Permaculture utilizes carefully chosen plants and domestic animals, as well as sometimes wildlife, for pest control.  For example one might plant thorny hedges to keep deer out of the food production area, while providing habitat for birds of prey so that that they can prevent rodents from becoming a problem.  Pests an never be entirely eliminated because predators always lag behind pests, but in this way they can be controlled so that they do not cause substantial damage in established permacultures.  A good beginner's book on this subject is [Gaia's Garden](http://www.amazon.com/Gaias-Garden-Second-Home-Scale-Permaculture/dp/1603580298).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second point is that species are arranged in ways which mutually support eachother.  I haven't been able to experiment with this but a example of an area where this might be helpful might be co-raising cattle and horses, together in an area that has snow so as to minimize the need for hay.  Cattle won't eat what they can't see so they tend to starve quickly when it snows, but horses will kick the snow away to eat.  Thus the horses can be used to help the cattle forage in winter.  If areas are maintained with sufficient forage, hay may not even be necessary (there are recorded cases of cowboys with herds stuck in winter storms following mustang herds in order to ensure the cattle could eat, and thus saving their herds).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The Necessity for Material Lifecycles to Mimic Ecosystems**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an ecosystem, the waste product of one species or element becomes the input of another.  Bears poop in the woods.  Micro-organisms break down the poop and they release waste products which plants take in.  Those plants may produce fruit and the bears eat the fruit.  The bears then poop and the cycle repeats.  This example shows the way in which nutrient cycles work in ecosystems, re-using and re-cycling all components and over time building quality soils and very efficient ways of transforming current solar energy into biological energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sustainability requires, among other things, that we stop polluting our environment with things which cannot readily be re-used in the biological context.  For this reason it is very important to develop closed material lifecycles.  Our current factory-to-landfill must eventually be replaced with a closed cycle where very little if anything ends up in land fills because everything is re-used in some context or another.  Doing this requires in essence having the output or waste of one system becoming the input of another.  Recycling is one way this can happen (re-use is another), but either way waste must be re-purposed as an asset.  An example might be privatizing sewage treatment, not as a waste disposal service, but as a series of cooking gas and fertilizer factories.  Waste products which cannot be recycled can be re-used in unexpected ways, such as building things out of &quot;urbanite.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The shift in thinking from a factory to landfill pipeline to a series of interconnected and infinitely continuous series of material lifecycles (akin to the water cycle, or to nutrient cycles in ecosystems), is absolutely necessary to achieving sustainability, and permaculture teaches this quite a bit.  This is a reason why I am such of a fan of urban permaculture.  While the idea of feeding a family of 4 on a city lot is probably unrealistic, the lessons learned about sustainability and the increase in free time from doing so (instead of high maintenance flower gardens!) is well worth it.  Most of my &quot;flower gardens&quot; also produce fruits and veggies, they look nice, and they require very, very little maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sustainable Communities**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The emphasis on the output of one component being the input of another has the potential at least to build close-knit, sustainable communities through garden exchanges, and also things like thinking about what one can re-use things that would otherwise be discarded.  Urbanite as a building material for small projects (say outdoor pizza ovens) comes to mind but the possibilities here are really endless.  The more we think about what we can do with waste, the less of it ends up being discarded in unsustainable ways and the closer we become as communities as we utilize the waste products of neighbors and vice versa,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sustainability Challenges**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The big one actually is manpower (and this is an issue for most green energy too btw but for very different reasons), and the second is education.  Building permacultures requires years of practice and/or significant training.  It also turns food production into an intellectually challenging activity.  However it is also less physically challenging than conventional agriculture in many cases, and so there are possibilities of closing loops here.  The problem with manpower though is not so easily overlooked.  With modern fossil-fuel-based agriculture it is not hard for an individual to successfully farm vast tracts of land, possibly in the hundreds of acres, with only seasonal help.  Permaculture requires more *people* to be working in food production.  It also requires that people make more careful choices regarding foods to consume (grains are less sustainable than chestnuts for example, and wheat is less sustainable than rice).  More people in &quot;farming&quot; full-time means fewer people engineering green energy solutions and the like.  Competition for manpower is thus a significant concern as I see it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR - Short version**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see permaculture as pretty close to a necessity for achieving sustainability both due to its direct effects and also its indirect effects.  I also see permaculture ultimately as the best current training ground for the sorts of patterns we must develop in order to achieve sustainability generally." />

Be careful re &quot;dimmable&quot; - some LED bulbs are, some aren't. Some can use standard phase control dimmers, while others can be dimmed only by using a custom control unit.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When replacing a 75 Watt incandescent you need ABOUT 10 - 15 Watts of LED power input  to produce the same total light output (lumens), **but** as the LED light is well directed in this application, the directionality of the LEDs compared to incandescent bulbs means that you would probably be happy with 5 to 10 Watts of total LED power. As LED lumen/Watt efficiency is going up continually, even 5 Watts can be &quot;very very bright&quot; in many applications. (An incandesecnt bulb may produce 15 lumen/Watt. Good modern LEDs give in excess of 120 l/W and last time I checked the top available-to-buy offering from Cree was managig 200 l/W in some very specific circumstances.). Whole lamp l/W will be less than for the LEDs alone due to diffusers, reflectors, power supply losses and stupid designs, but approaching 100 l/W is common enough and higher is becoming available. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most basic but easiest method would be to start with LEDs and suitable heat sink mountings and use an external power supply fed through the existing wiring. This would allow the lamp to be very close to standard in appearance but involves non standard playing at the other end of the wiring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closest to 'plug in and go&quot; (apart from a correctly fitting lamp) is any of the many many LED lamps now available that meets your spec as above, some bases from old bulbs , some suitable adhesive and time skill and patience. With the correct LED lamp it's literally just a matter of connecting the 2 existing wires to the 2 wires from the bulb.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important factor in many cases is the LED lamp's CRI (Colour Rendering Index). This is a subjective measurement based on a number of colour samples which tells you how well the LED renders the colours of various items compared to a standard tungsten filament incandescent lamp. A tugsten lamp is defined as having a CRI of 100 and LEds can approach that when great care is taken. Not surprisingly, Philips are among the leaders in making high CRI LED lamps.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A CRI of &gt;= 90 is extremely good and few would notice the difference.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A CRI of 80 is good for most purposes by a degree of colour difference is noticeable by many people. Most tasks can be done without major problems.      &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A CRI of 70 gives light which definitely gives non-tungsten results. These are acceptable in many applications but the difference is clear. eg you'd happily eat a meal, read a book, do homework etc. Colours would be &quot;off&quot; but this would not generally matter except when the colour was a significant part of the task eg looking at photos.  &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - A CRI of 60 is OK for area illumination where colour is not at all important. Camping, tyre changing, night time sports, market stalls (colour suffers), ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A CRI of under 60 will usually be an actinic blue tinged light pretending to be White. Such LEds are also usually low quality and low lifetime. Their advantages are high light output per power input, all else being equal. Don't buy them!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hand in hand with CRI is CCT (correlated colo[u]r temperature - but if you get the CRI that you want then CCT will follow. CCT is expressed in degrees Kelvin (same size degree steps as Celsius but starting at absolute zero of = -273 C.)  Tungsten has a CCT of about 2900 K, Halogen 3200K, sunlight 5600 K, shade about 7500K. To get a CRI of near 100, CCT will be around 2800K. A CCT of about 6000K is getting down to a CRI of about 70. I personally prefer light of about 6000-7000 K to that of tungsten - slightly on the shady side of noon sunlight. Some love the horrible orange yukky look of tungsten bulbs :-). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**See pictures at end.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;____________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Related:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two crucial points are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - LED lifetimes are greatly affected by temperature.

You may get less for the reason that the hot air may rise as a mass (rather than trickling out) and thus have less impact on the rest of the air.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As some of the others have said the issue efficiency-wise will have to do with hot air pooling in the ceiling.  The best way to prevent this is with a fan of some sort, to keep the air moving and mixing.    You may find that use of a fan by itself captures a fair bit of your cooking heat and that this helps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a warning however, I have noticed a few major problems with re-capturing electrical cooking heat.  In particular if the heat is used to boil water, I have found that the opposite of what I expected to happen in fact did --- the house was made *colder* by the added hot steam, compared to not cooking at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My working theory is that what happens is that the steam condenses on the windows and other surfaces that are not as well insulated.  They deposit heat there, and then evaporate slowly pulling heat from the room to do so.  They then condense again, depositing this heat wherever the house is least well insulated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So pay attention, experiment, and be careful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as health hazards, once you have turned off the oven, the gas has to go somewhere.  It's going to go into your house whether you leave the oven door open or not.  Again, my gut feeling says that you will lose more than you gain by opening the oven door, but I can't be sure." />

The idea is that the charcoal improves the soil's carbon content and functions as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2. This would be especially useful for depleted soils. The idea of using charcoil to enhance to soil was derived from the [Terra Preta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta) found in the Amazone. Terra Preta is very dark and rich soil with high content of charcoil that supposedly was created by Amazone natives between 450 BC and 950 AD.

Raw biochar needs to be mixed with compost and water before adding it to your garden or else it will draw nutrients and water away from your plants. How much to add depends on the type of soil you have and possibly on what you want to grow, so you may want to do a soil analysis first. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is quite a bit of professional research going on, as well as people experimenting themselves (just search the internet).

Use of something like the &quot;*Reecharger*&quot; that you mention is not essential, does extremely little for you and, if their description of their own products are accurate, the Reecharger is a badly designed piece of equipment that has major problems. Brief notes justifying this rather unlikely sounding claim are at the end of this answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any rechargeable battery with a voltage of up to about 6 Volts will be usable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The SHD (Shimano Hub Dyno) makes about 3 Watts - 6V x 0.5A at rated output. This is at relatively low RPM due to bicycle use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any battery that can tolerate a charge rate of up to 0.5A is acceptable - and any modern rechargeable battery from about AA size on up would be suitable. You need some additional simple circuitry which I'll describe below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Read my answer here on stack exchange Electrical Engineering [Building a new dynamo bike light](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/58718/building-a-new-dynamo-bike-light/58728#58728).  From there you will find an indirect link to this [PDA / GPS bike mounted USB charger](http://www.arenddeboer.com/bike-mounted-usb-charger) This doubles the voltage from the hub dyno to allow low speed operation. His circuit (shown below) may be somewhat daunting if you have never built such but he discusses what is involved and you can get advice on the stack exchange electrical engineering page if you decided to pursue this. Cost of this is probably a few GBP - if you pursue this people on the EE site (including me) would be happy to comment on what is needed for battery charging. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__________________________&#xD;&#xA;**How fast does it need to be turned?**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine we have a 26&quot; diameter wheel with 1&quot; of tyre thickness so total diameter ~~~= 28&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA; At 30 mph = 44 feet/second the dynamo should be at full output - possibly so at half that.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Circumference of a wheel is about 28&quot; x Pi / 12 feet = 7.3 feet.  &#xD;&#xA; 30 mph = 44 feet per second. &#xD;&#xA; So at 30 mph the wheel will turn 44/7.3 = 6 turns per second&#xD;&#xA;= 60 seconds/minute x  6 revs/second = 360 RPM  &#xD;&#xA;Or 180 RPM at 15 mph.     &#xD;&#xA;This is &quot;nice and slow&quot; by wind turbine standards and makes it much more usable than many alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Output is AC so you will need a &quot;bridge rectifier&quot; - this has 4 diodes in it and allows DC to be produced from 2 wire AC. Any small modern silicon bridge rectifier from a hobby electronics shop with a rating of 0.5A or more will do. Voltage rating of any bridge rectifier being sold will be &gt; 6VAC so is unimportant. You MAY find some very very very (decades) old Germanium or copper oxide or selenium rectifiers. Do not use them. A suitable modern bridge rectifier should cost well under 1 GBP. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A bridge rectifier has 4 terminals - two AC inputs (connect either way to the dynamo output wires) and a positive and negative output. Positive goes to battery positive, negative to battery negative, 2 x AC input go to dynamo. Adding a filter capacitor would help if you were powering other equipment rather than battery charging, but for battery charging it is not strictly necessary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use a &quot;regulator&quot; between the battery and dynamo but, for initial investigation, the most that is strictly essential is a means of limiting maximum voltage applied to the battery. The simplest and most effective means in this context is a &quot;clamp regulator&quot;. This has 2 wires, connects directly to the battery and usually does nothing whatsoever. If the battery ever rises to a certain present voltage under charge the clamp regulator will &quot;shunt&quot; current to limit the battery voltage to the desired maximum. The regulator can be more complex than that, but that will do well enough in this context in many cases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;________________________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Battery types:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Anything rechargeable&quot; :-).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**LiIon or Lithium Polymer.**   &#xD;&#xA;OK&#xD;&#xA;MUST have a voltage clamp at 4.2V or perhaps a little lower.    &#xD;&#xA;MUST have.    &#xD;&#xA;A zener diode is &quot;too soft&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;Ask if more information needed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;LiFePO4 similar to LiIon but lower clamp voltage needed.

They say    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot; ... For a 20&quot; wheel, sustaining speeds over 25km/h (~15.5mph) for long periods may overload the power regulator so we discourage riding above this speed with the power regulator engaged. 3W hubs can also generate more power than 2.4W ones under the same speed. The 20&quot;-25km/h rating is for a 2.4W hub.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - For larger wheels, proportionately greater speeds can be sustained. Our tests show that a standard 26&quot; wheel can go up to 35~40km/hr (21~25mph) without any problem for the power regulator.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;My 26&quot; where example noted that 30 mph gave 360 RPM - so their safe max speed is about say 300 RPM. Achievable RPM with a wind turbine will depend on design or happenstance, but 300 RPM is an unusually low expected maximum RPM for a wind turbine - possible even for one with bicycle wheel rotor with duct-tape blades (I like it). You can certainly limit the speed by various means BUT you should not need to. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When they say &quot; ... If your hub outputs *the 6V current* that is standard for most dynamo hubs ...&quot; we all know what they mean, but one would be wise to wonder about their technical abilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They say &quot;The power regulator should be disconnected from the hub when it’s not charging the ReeCharge Power Pack to prevent overloading the power regulator.&quot; - which is wholly unacceptable for something made to be used on we dark windswept nights or sudden unexpected exhilarating downhills. The unloaded voltages encountered are modest by any reasonable design standards. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Think thrice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/I8h3x.gif" />

All else beeing equal, the difference between an energy-efficient process and an inefficient on may mean the difference between sustainablity or insustainability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that, as you change towards more efficient processes, more sources of energy might become viable.

To summarize what is told there (check for more detail), there would be several considerations as related to energy use and sustainability:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Idling in itself wastes fuel for no good reason, and that adds up. In US (country whose residents drive probably more than anyone else on Earth, to put it in perspective) the average cars idles 16 minutes a day (including warming up, waiting, and sitting in traffic). Even 2.0 L compact car would burn (at a rate of 1L per hour) almost 100 L of fuel a year. Obviously, some idling is unavoidable, but even half of that saved and multiplied by the number of all the cars in the world would amount to significant impact.&#xD;&#xA;* Idling negatively affects the engine internals due to incomplete combustion (glazing of the combustion chamber, fouling of the spark plugs) which further decreases fuel efficiency for all other regimes of operation.&#xD;&#xA;* What’s more, excessive idling affects other components (burning up of the catalytic converter, increased corrosion of exhaust system, increased engine wear due to higher vibration etc.), whose premature wear and replacement lead to increased use of raw materials.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What one can do (and what I do) is to turn off engine during long traffic lights, railway crossings and so forth. Anything more than 10 to 15 (generously) seconds would save fuel, because car that is already warm does not need that much effort to re-start, as it is at the proper operating temperature, and oil is distributed around the engine and at a high lubricity. Motor stays within the efficient range of temperatures for more than few minutes, and takes several hours to completely cool down (depending on the weather), so there is definitely no need to keep the car running during short errand (never mind someone could simply run off with the vehicle).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any concerns about premature wear of the starting infrastructure are moot considering savings on fuel and other engine components.

Use of something like the &quot;*Reecharger*&quot; that you mention is not essential, does extremely little for you and, if their description of their own products are accurate, the Reecharger is a badly designed piece of equipment that has major problems. Brief notes justifying this rather unlikely sounding claim are at the end of this answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any rechargeable battery with a voltage of up to about 6 Volts will be usable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The SHD (Shimano Hub Dyno) makes about 3 Watts - 6V x 0.5A at rated output. This is at relatively low RPM due to bicycle use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any battery that can tolerate a charge rate of up to 0.5A is acceptable - and any modern rechargeable battery from about AA size on up would be suitable. You need some additional simple circuitry which I'll describe below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Read my answer here on stack exchange Electrical Engineering [Building a new dynamo bike light](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/58718/building-a-new-dynamo-bike-light/58728#58728).  From there you will find an indirect link to this [PDA / GPS bike mounted USB charger](http://www.arenddeboer.com/bike-mounted-usb-charger) This doubles the voltage from the hub dyno to allow low speed operation. His circuit (shown below) may be somewhat daunting if you have never built such but he discusses what is involved and you can get advice on the stack exchange electrical engineering page if you decided to pursue this. Cost of this is probably a few GBP - if you pursue this people on the EE site (including me) would be happy to comment on what is needed for battery charging. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bicycle electronics site:**  Here is an [***excellent*** site with mini projects relating to bicycle electronics including bicycle alternator circuits**](http://www.pilom.com/BicycleElectronics/BicycleElectronics.htm)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__________________________&#xD;&#xA;**How fast does it need to be turned?**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine we have a 26&quot; diameter wheel with 1&quot; of tyre thickness so total diameter ~~~= 28&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA; At 30 mph = 44 feet/second the dynamo should be at full output - possibly so at half that.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Circumference of a wheel is about 28&quot; x Pi / 12 feet = 7.3 feet.  &#xD;&#xA; 30 mph = 44 feet per second. &#xD;&#xA; So at 30 mph the wheel will turn 44/7.3 = 6 turns per second&#xD;&#xA;= 60 seconds/minute x  6 revs/second = 360 RPM  &#xD;&#xA;Or 180 RPM at 15 mph.     &#xD;&#xA;This is &quot;nice and slow&quot; by wind turbine standards and makes it much more usable than many alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Output is AC so you will need a &quot;bridge rectifier&quot; - this has 4 diodes in it and allows DC to be produced from 2 wire AC. Any small modern silicon bridge rectifier from a hobby electronics shop with a rating of 0.5A or more will do. Voltage rating of any bridge rectifier being sold will be &gt; 6VAC so is unimportant. You MAY find some very very very (decades) old Germanium or copper oxide or selenium rectifiers. Do not use them. A suitable modern bridge rectifier should cost well under 1 GBP. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A bridge rectifier has 4 terminals - two AC inputs (connect either way to the dynamo output wires) and a positive and negative output. Positive goes to battery positive, negative to battery negative, 2 x AC input go to dynamo. Adding a filter capacitor would help if you were powering other equipment rather than battery charging, but for battery charging it is not strictly necessary. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use a &quot;regulator&quot; between the battery and dynamo but, for initial investigation, the most that is strictly essential is a means of limiting maximum voltage applied to the battery. The simplest and most effective means in this context is a &quot;clamp regulator&quot;. This has 2 wires, connects directly to the battery and usually does nothing whatsoever. If the battery ever rises to a certain present voltage under charge the clamp regulator will &quot;shunt&quot; current to limit the battery voltage to the desired maximum. The regulator can be more complex than that, but that will do well enough in this context in many cases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;________________________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Battery types:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Anything rechargeable&quot; :-).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**LiIon or Lithium Polymer.**   &#xD;&#xA;OK&#xD;&#xA;MUST have a voltage clamp at 4.2V or perhaps a little lower.    &#xD;&#xA;MUST have.    &#xD;&#xA;A zener diode is &quot;too soft&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;Ask if more information needed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;LiFePO4 similar to LiIon but lower clamp voltage needed. A superb battery type but not necessary here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**NimH x 3.**  (Or NiCd x 3) &#xD;&#xA;Need about 4.5V.  &#xD;&#xA;NimH x 4 may be a good choice as they will charge when :&quot;flat&quot; but never get to full capacity imn most cases so will self limit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With 3 cells a battery voltage clamp is a good idea but not totally necessary. Under most wind conditions yo are liable to get, if you use the light daily Vbattery may be OK uncontrolled.&#xD;&#xA;Worst case you cook you NimH early.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Reecharger you mention probably looks after battery management for you but is very very dear for what you get. Buying a bare battery and playing is advised. Note voltage warning. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Lead Acid** - 6V a bit marginally high - need to check dyno and see what voltage it REALLY makes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4V Lead Acid OK. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;____________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**BioLogic ReCharge Power Pack** - [home page here](http://www.thinkbiologic.com/products/reecharge-power-pack).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Dynamo powered battery charger should&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Work with a wide range of typical dynamos &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Tolerate usual dynamo input conditions regardless of battery state or battery presence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Not be damaged by over voltage, under loading, overloading, ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Ideally would have a replaceable battery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Be described in technical terms that demonstrate that the seller or manufacturer understands the product and which give confidence that the product meets the specs given.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Be priced at a fair market price for what it does. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ReeCharge unit fails on all these points.   &#xD;&#xA;[Here in their FAQ](https://thinkbiologic.zendesk.com/forums/20189876-reecharge-power-pack) they explicitly say that you may damage it if you ride too fast. They say    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - &quot; ... For a 20&quot; wheel, sustaining speeds over 25km/h (~15.5mph) for long periods may overload the power regulator so we discourage riding above this speed with the power regulator engaged. 3W hubs can also generate more power than 2.4W ones under the same speed. The 20&quot;-25km/h rating is for a 2.4W hub.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - For larger wheels, proportionately greater speeds can be sustained. Our tests show that a standard 26&quot; wheel can go up to 35~40km/hr (21~25mph) without any problem for the power regulator.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;My 26&quot; where example noted that 30 mph gave 360 RPM - so their safe max speed is about say 300 RPM. Achievable RPM with a wind turbine will depend on design or happenstance, but 300 RPM is an unusually low expected maximum RPM for a wind turbine - possible even for one with bicycle wheel rotor with duct-tape blades (I like it). You can certainly limit the speed by various means BUT you should not need to. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When they say &quot; ... If your hub outputs *the 6V current* that is standard for most dynamo hubs ...&quot; we all know what they mean, but one would be wise to wonder about their technical abilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They say &quot;The power regulator should be disconnected from the hub when it’s not charging the ReeCharge Power Pack to prevent overloading the power regulator.&quot; - which is wholly unacceptable for something made to be used on we dark windswept nights or sudden unexpected exhilarating downhills. The unloaded voltages encountered are modest by any reasonable design standards. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Think thrice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/I8h3x.gif" />

Well, it will depend on how the specific scheme is implemented, what the renewable suppliers are, and what timescale you are considering. So, the answer could be yes, no or maybe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know about your supplier's particular plan, and in order to keep this answer useful to as many readers as possible, I'll talk about the generalities that make a difference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Generation-specific&#xD;&#xA;Most renewable sources have such low short-run marginal costs that they'll run pretty much any time, regardless of the current price in the market. So an increase in demand from consumers on renewable tariffs is very unlikely to result in immediate increase in renewable supply. There might be corner cases on small grids where the marginal producer is a renewable supplier with non-trivial short-run marginal costs, such as biomass or biogas: in such cases, increased demand from people on 100% renewable tariffs could cause an immediate and equivalent increase in renewable supply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Scheme-specific&#xD;&#xA;Most 100%-renewable tariffs tend to be based on the trading of certificates-of-origin of renewable electricity. Whether your tariff really makes a difference, will depend on whether or not there is a surplus of such certificates in the market.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Surplus**: If there *is* a surplus, and it is expected that there will continue to be a surplus, (as is the case Britain with the REGOs - Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin) then no, the tariff makes no difference at all. The situation in this case is exactly as you describe: &quot;your&quot; electricity becomes 100% renewable, and the electricity of those on the &quot;conventional&quot; plan has a higher proportion of non-renewable energy than before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**No surplus**: If there is *not* a surplus of such certificates now, or there is expected not to be one over the next few years, then the price of those certificates will rise, incentivising investment in new renewable generation infrastructure. The increase in renewable generation might be more or less than the amount you have consumed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Company-specific&#xD;&#xA;Some companies (such as [Ecotricity][1] in the UK) choose to invest a large proportion of their revenue into new renewable capacity. So buying from a company such as them, **does** increase renewable electricity production, over the scale of years, regardless of what's going on with the generation-specific and scheme-specific issues set out above. In such cases, the increase in renewable generation tends to be much more than the amount you have consumed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/for-your-home/greenest-outcome" />

Reason:  It doubled the amount of solid waste in the sewer system.  The additional solids also made for more problems with blockages.  We have friends there, who, despite having a yard the size of a commerative postage stamp compost nearly everything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;City of Edmonton has a very advanced garbage sorting system, and kitchen waste is composted in bulk, along with yard waste, wood scrap, and non-recycleable paper.  (I buy a 60 cubic yard trailer of it per year for my tree farm)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall I would argue that a landfill tolerates 'too much' better than a sewage system does.  City of Edmonton made the mistake years ago of having the storm drain system tied into the their sewage system.  So at peak rainfall or snow melt, there is too much water to treat properly, and semi-raw sewaage goes into the river.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there are better choices than either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Vermiculture.  A 70 liter tote makes an excellent worm farm, and will handle all of the non-meat kitchen waste a couple can generate.  And the commpost is good for the garden&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Having a city that composts -- agitate for it, and point to CoE as the example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Keep guinea pigs. They will eat all the kitchen waste including the mean scraps. This is the traditional disposal method in Peru.  Every now and then you have roast guinea pig for supper.  Quite tasty.  It will pick up the flavour of the dominant scraps fed it.  I had some once that were fed on fish offal.  Very odd to have something with the texture of turkey breast, and the taste of tuna.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4.  Do conventional composting in the back yard.  Takes more room that worms, but it's even easier.  7 pallets, available for the taking in any industrial area (ask first), and be set up as a 3 bin compost system in an afternoon." />

The basis for the claim can be seen in various sources but it is arguably not justified as a pithy one line summary of the factors that drive Danish wind power installations in and leading up to 2000. Read on ...**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The original &quot;Energy 81&quot; incentive set targets and these were adjusted along the way by agreement and negotiation between government and industry. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The refence in (2) below gives a reasonably blow-by-blow description of the timing and nature of major relevant incentives. Repowering is not mentioned per se but you can easily see where it might fit in to such a program, laden with incentives to do new better things, create jobs, meet increased performance targets etc. Note the electricity production support scheme described as &quot;only for gas from 2000&quot; - that sounds like a very major reason to get any qualifying wind turbine work completed BY 2000. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;____________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1) This UK Tyndal Centre report gives a reasonable brief summary of the issues and processes and timetables involved.    &#xD;&#xA;[**The role of political uncertainty in the Danish renewable energy market**](http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wp76.pdf). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of significance is their comment about per turbine capacities. The original legislation was framed with both total megawatt capacity and turbine count targets in mind. The growth in per-turbine capacity was not anticipated originally and repowering was a consequence of the better economics achievable by obtaining more power (and energy) from a given site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Their section 2.1 notes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The first target for the deployment of wind power is found in Energy 81: 60,000 windmills to supply 10% of electricity by 2000. In 1990 a program was introduced to build 100MW of wind (Gronheit, 2002). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; In 1996 the government and utilities signed an agreement for the installation of&#xD;&#xA;200 MW. Utilities were already responsible for a target of 1,500 MW by 2005.   &#xD;&#xA;However, at the end of 2000 almost 2,300 MW wind capacity had been already installed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It is worth noting that in 1997 the number of turbines was under 5,000, i.e. far below the target introduced in Energy 81. The increased size of turbines had not been forecasted by the legislation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; In 1998 utilities signed an agreement to install 750 MW offshore wind turbine before 2008. According to government’s forecast, these turbines would generate 10% of the electricity consumption. The agreement is considered the first phase of a total 4,000 MW installation before 2030. According to reports from the Ministry of Environment, the capacity for offshore wind is 12,000 MW or 30-40 TWh in generation terms (DEA, 2002). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) Here is a summary of key Danish legislative steps along the way from about 1990. Note that it is not possible to with certitude fit any one action to a repowering spike in 2000, but the relationship of the various actions to what occurred is traceable in general terms. [Denmarks's Green industrial development](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19817/41690)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a subset of those with arguable relevance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1993 Wind turbine obligations** - utilities pay high rate (85% of consumer price) for electricity from wind, plus subsidies, plus CO2 tax rebate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 1994 Green taxes, including energy &amp; transport taxes - positive results in terms of emissions, industry behaviour and technological development. Continually revised. €10bn revenue in 2000.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1996 Energy21 policy - set target for 20% consumption from renewables by 2003.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 1996 Electricity Act, supporting the development of all renewable energy technologies ~ utilities forced to give priority access to RE and pay 85% of consumer price. **Utilities set target of 1,500MW from wind turbines by 2005 (met end 2000, with 2,100MW installed).** Target of 50% of primary energy use from renewables (79% of electricity) set for 2030.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1996-7 Number of Government 'Executive Orders' - provide subsidies of 15 to 30% of the construction costs for renewable energy equipment.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 1997 - 1999 Introduction of policies to support the research and development of new products and processes, and the uptake of these by Danish enterprises.

The Act - originally from 1976 - also enables the Minister of Energy to order electricity supply companies to use specific fuels and specific modes of generation. The &quot;modes of generation&quot; can be used to ensure that new capacity is in the form of combined heat and power plants, wind turbines, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- In 1985, ... the Minister of Energy and the power companies signed an agreement securing the construction of 100 MW of wind power capacity before 1991.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- In 1990, after a similar agreement, the power companies agreed to establish another 100 MW of wind capacity before 1994.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **In February 1996, the Minister for Environment and Energy announced a new agreement with the main electricity utilities to establish an additional 200 MW wind capacity during the next four years.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(4) The 2000 peak is not overly pronounced here ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark) )&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;____________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The motivation is summarised in passing in [Repowering of Wind Turbines: Economics and Optimal Timing  ](http://www.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaacoynw) - reference details at end of this answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They say: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The development of wind power utilization in Denmark has been characterized by strong public involvement. The first target can be found in Decree Energy 81: the installation of 60,000 windmills to supply 10% of the electricity demand by 2000, a target that had already been reached in 1998 with fewer than 5000 turbines (Agnolucci, 2007). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **In the early 1990s, a second target was announced by the government, namely to build 100 MW of wind power capacity, while in 1996 the utilities and the government signed a target agreement to install 1500 MW by 2005.** Indeed, at the end of 2000, 2300 MW had already been installed (Agnolucci, 2007).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2012 -  [Energy policy in Denmark](http://www.ens.dk/Documents/Netboghandel%20-%20publikationer/2013/Energy%20Policy%20in%20Denmark.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2006 - [Global wind report](http://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gwec-2006_final_01.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Wind power in Denmark - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Why wind power works for Denmark](http://incoteco.com/upload/CIEN.158.2.66.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Wind targets for Europe 2020, 2030](http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/reports/Pure_Power_III.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;============================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**re**&#xD;&#xA;________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: The aim of repowering is to make better use of wind resources on existing sites. Older sites can be &quot;fully populated&quot; by turbines in the 100's of kW range such that no new turbines can be installed. By replacing existing turbines with fewer much larger turbines with much higher mean heights an increased amount of energy can be intercepted for the same site area. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The picture below is from [Europe Replaces Old Wind Farms](http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/wind/europe-replaces-old-wind-farms)   &#xD;&#xA;The amazingly similar [tm] cloud formations indicates that this is a conceptual rather than actual &quot;after&quot; example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They say: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Photo-illustration: Bundesverband WindEnergie.  &#xD;&#xA; A wind farm at Simonsberg, in northern Germany, would produce more electricity with just a few large turbines than it does with many small ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;FCN Working Paper No. 19/2011  &#xD;&#xA;Repowering of Wind Turbines: Economics and Optimal Timing  &#xD;&#xA;Sebastian Himpler and Reinhard Madlener  &#xD;&#xA;November 2011 Revised July 2012  &#xD;&#xA;Institute for Future Energy Consumer Needs and Behavior (FCN)  &#xD;&#xA;School of Business and Economics / E.ON ERC  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/1rLUY.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/rBL8Z.jpg" />

To add to this, consider the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many in the sanitation treatment industry feel the garbage disposal was among the most troublesome inventions in the history of the modern home.  Treatment facilities are designed to remove bacterial and viral contaminants, not solid wastes (grinding it and sending it into the sewer system does not change the fact that it is solid waste).  Most plants have been retrofitted to remove the increased volume of food waste (among other things), but it is no where near as efficient as composting this waste stream.  Essentially, using a garbage disposal is another way to outsource waste removal without paying additionally for it, and it puts an undue burden on infrastructure.  To see this process in action, and to see what happens when food waste is co-mingled with wastewater, I highly recommend taking a tour of your local treatment facility - usually this is a free service provided to citizens.  For example, if you live in southern California, the Orange County Sanitation District and Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts will offer free tours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.ocsd.com/index.aspx?page=115&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.lacsd.org/education/tours/default.asp&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Composting is relatively easy, although it does require a bit of maintenance.  If you have a backyard, outdoor composting is definitely the preferred solution - there are plenty of websites out there that will provide instructions.  If you live in an apartment or have limited space, consider worm composting.  If done properly, there is no odor, and the end product (worm casting &quot;poo&quot;) makes for perfect potting soil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Composting (as above) should only be done with specific kinds of scraps - e.g. fruits, veggies, breads, egg shells, garden cuttings, etc.  Do NOT add fats, oils, meats, or dairy products.  I had never heard of guinea pigs as a disposal method - cool idea! Along those same lines, many people in the U.S. are using chickens to achieve the same goal.  Chickens will eat anything, including meats, fats, dairy products, cooked food, etc!  But check your city or county ordinances to make sure this is approved in your area." />

However, mining minerals from the sea can be very energy intensive, according to a lot of sources, [mdpi](http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/4/980/pdf) for instance.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;High energy intensity, depending on the energy source used, could actually lead to more air pollution, including GHGs." />

Can take a greater variety of wastes than conventional composting (including meat, bone, cooked food, etc.) Requires Bokashi bran for the particular microbes that work on the food scraps, called &quot;Effective Microorganisms&quot; or EM-1. Every time you add food scraps to your container you cover them with a handful of Bokashi bran, which contains the bacteria, fungi, etc. which break down the cellulose in the scraps. When the bucket is full, you set it aside for 2 weeks and then bury the contents in dirt. If you live in an apartment, you can use the material for container gardening or donate it to someone who has a garden or to a community garden.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I like best about Bokashi is that it's pretty simple to do (compared with vermiculture, chickens or guinea pigs). And it demonstrates that one's food waste doesn't have to be regarded as waste at all. You can watch it become awesome fertilizer with most or all the nutrients intact (preserved by fermentation) to grow some new, tasty food.  " />

Seawater contains large amounts of dissolved ions and the four most concentrated metal ones (Na, Mg, Ca, K) are being commercially extracted today. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; However, all the other metal ions exist at much lower concentrations. This paper reports an estimate of the feasibility of the extraction of these metal ions on the basis of the energy needed. In most cases, the result is that extraction in amounts comparable to the present production from land mines would be impossible because of the very large amount of energy needed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This conclusion holds also for uranium as fuel for the present generation of nuclear fission plants. Nevertheless, in a few cases, mainly lithium, extraction from seawater could provide amounts of metals sufficient for closing the cycle of metal use in the economy, provided that an increased level of recycling can be attained.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(3) **Ref1:**   This excellent paper discusses the issues involved and provides details of attempts to extract Uranium and Lithium. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [**Mining the Oceans: Can We Extract Minerals from Seawater?**](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4558)  &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; Ugo Bardi - September 22, 2008  &#xD;&#xA;Website: The Oil Drum: Europe   &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;An image in Ref1 shows Japanese researchers investigating Uranium extraction!  &#xD;&#xA;They say - &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The four most concentrated metal ions, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+, are the only ones commercially extractable today, with the the least concentrated of the four being potassium (K) at 400 parts per million (ppm).   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **Below potassium, we go down to lithium, which has never been extracted in commercial amounts from seawater, with a concentration of 0.17 ppm.**  &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; Other dissolved metal ions exist at lower concentrations, sometimes several orders of magnitude lower.   &#xD;&#xA;**None has ever been commercially extracted.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A company set up in New Zealand a decade + ago to do Lithium extraction. It SOUNDED plausible and much money was spent. The promotrer turned out to be an internationally known con-man! :-(.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The main problem - energy cost and return.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From Ref 1:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Table 2.

For data sources, see note (1) at the end of the text&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The table shows that, even for the best case listed, lithium, in order to recover the same amount we get today from conventional mining we would need to set gigantic facilities. **We'd need to process at least ten times as much water as it is processed by desalination plants today.** All the other metals would require to process amounts of water orders of magnitude larger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moving these gigantic amounts of water is **not just a practical problem**:   &#xD;&#xA;**it involves energy**; a critical parameter especially if we consider the extraction of two elements that are to be used as energy sources: lithium and uranium. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **In both cases, the feasibility of extraction is determined by the energy needed according to the well known concept of &quot;EROEI&quot; (energy returned for energy investment) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;______________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Related:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(4) [The geochemistry of seawater](http://liquidminerals.blogspot.co.nz/2007/06/sea-water.html)  &#xD;&#xA;[Table of 84 minerals in seawater here {jpg image}](http://liquidminerals.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/seawater_analysis.jpg)  Copied below - order inobvious. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/hpC9C.jpg" />

Added more material to address the trade-offs" Text="Much depends on what you consider sustainable. The two major sustainability questions concern the energy to produce it,  and the resource used to produce it.  Additional concerns are the difficulty to recycle/dispose of at end of life, and the costs of both moving the resource to manufacturing point, and moving the product to the use point.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AFAIK there is no general purpose definition.  Here's some comparisons and tradeoffs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Group 1.  Plastic/Petrochemical&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Vinyl** -- probably one of the worst picks.  All sorts of poisonous byproducts in it's manufacture, and in disposal.  Relatively innocuous in use.  Lifetime 15-25 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Shingle** -- Similar to the standard asphalt and fiber and rock shingles used on roofs, but designed to be used vertically.  Tend to last longer as siding than they do as roof, because there is no snow load, no hail, less sun.  Not terribly hard on the environment -- basically the same material as roads with glass fiber added.  As long as we are going to use fossil fuel, we will have a surplus of asphalt.  Of this group, I consdier this one most sustainable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Group 2:  Wood based.  Wood is the only fully renewable material on this list, so in that sense is the most sustainable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wood slab.**  Formed from the first cut off the side of a log, bark scraped off, and a half lap rabbeted on each side.  Requires new coat of log oil every 5 years or so. Very sustainable -- better use than for fuel, which is otherwise what happens to slabs. Very time consuming to put on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Clapboard.**  Requires large trees as feed stock, and so competes with the other uses for large trees.  If Cedar clapboard is used, puts higher demand on an already high demand wood.  Requires regular painting.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tongue &amp; Groove Milled siding.**  Similar to clapboard but both thicker and narrower.  Can be made with smaller trees.  Uses more wood overall.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Chip based siding** -- Made from slash and scrap wood. Requires regular painting. Requires significant petrochemical resins to bond the chips together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Group 3 Metal based. Metal siding requires careful attention to the details around doors and windows.  It also has zero water permiability, so some form of ventilation or rain screen needs to be behind the siding. Metal siding usually won't require care once up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aluminum siding.  High initial embodied energy cost, but will last a very very long time.  Subject to dents.  Aluminum recycles quite well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Steel siding.  Lower energy than aluminum, but also lower lifetime.  Better dent resistance.    Also endlessly recyclable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Group 4.  Cementaceous based siding.  Relatively high emboddied energy, and low recycleability.  Used material is only good for fill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Portland cement and fiber:** Portland cement is one of the highest energy materials out there -- a significant amount of our cultures total energy budget is spent making portland cement.  In that sense it's unsustainnable.  The raw material is limestone, and we have whole mountains made of it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fiber can be one of several minerals, indlcuding asbestos, serpentine, rock wool from slag, spun glass from recycled glass.  Coloring can be either embedded mineral pigments, or painted.  If embedded will last a very long time.  Essentially impossible to recycle -- use as fill.  Note that it requires a lab test to determine if the fiber component is asbestos.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Lime/Earth Plaster:**  See any resource on strawbale building.  The energy cost of lime is much smaller than for portland cement, and earth based is just clay and fine sand.  However the usual use is with buildings with wide eaves to reduce the amount of rain hitting them.  They are very labour intensive to apply, and require attention to maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stucco:**  Relatively cheap, long lasting, but very limited in available colours.  While it can be painted, it seldom is.  Stucco housing developments tend to be grey and dreary looking. Stucco is also based on portland cement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, My opinion is that the wood slab siding is the most sustainable.  The resource is renewable, the energy costs moderate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second on my list are the lime/earth based plasters if you have a house/climate that allow it. Stucco comes close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third on my list is steel siding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A better answer than this would require  deciding which factors are most important, as well as energy and resource use of the particular product and manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ultimate sustainable action is to do nothing.  It requires no energy, no resources.  If the present siding works and is not harming you while present, the the most sustainable siding is the present siding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Original Answer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No, it's not a health concern.  Right now it's locked up as siding.  If you remove it, you will break it up, make dust, which IS a health problem, but sitting there bonded to concrete on the side of your house it is harmless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep it painted to keep dust from spalling off of it. although that is a pretty minor concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even asbestos insulation is largely harmless once in place.  The hazard is in working around it, with it, but asbestos bonded into tile or cement siding is reasonably safe unless some process is turning it into powder." />

Reforestation.  This is slow to get started, and ultimately buys us only a few decades.  A forest will soon (50-200 years) get into equilibrium where decomposition and photosynthesis balance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Charcoal in the soil.  Charcoal does not degrade rapidly, and has positive effects on the nutrient storage capability of the soil.  The science is still new, and not well understood.  Google 'terra preta'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this to be successful, all it would take is a reasonable way to heat a barn using a charcoal generator fueled with farm waste (corn stalks, straw, moldy hay) In a nutshell, you need to burn roughly twice the fuel, but half of it is turned into charcoal, which you can either put on your own fields, or sell.  The science of this is still new.  Stay tuned.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other possibilities.  Fertilizing the oceans with iron comes up, but I don't think we understand oceanic ecology well enough.  It would be a bitch to measure progress.

Text="A ton of coal is roughly 240 kWh of electricity.  At present, the coal mine north of me charges the local power company something like $1.90 /ton for coal.  So the fuel cost is about a cent per kWh.  The wholesale price of electricty is about $.03/kWh.  The retail price of that power is $.15/kWh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A $24/ton carbon tax would be 10 cents/kWH.  That's enough to make people start looking for better ways.  Wind and solar start looking very attractive. $100/ton would raise power costs by 50 cents/kWh. Almost any renewable power can be efficient at this level.  Note that natural gas releases a lot less carbon per kWh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I stray from the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two most promising ways I see at this point:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Reforestation.  This is slow to get started, and ultimately buys us only a few decades.  A forest will soon (50-200 years) get into equilibrium where decomposition and photosynthesis balance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Charcoal in the soil.  Charcoal does not degrade rapidly, and has positive effects on the nutrient storage capability of the soil.  The science is still new, and not well understood.  Google 'terra preta'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this to be successful, all it would take is a reasonable way to heat a barn using a charcoal generator fueled with farm waste (corn stalks, straw, moldy hay) In a nutshell, you need to burn roughly twice the fuel, but half of it is turned into charcoal, which you can either put on your own fields, or sell.  The science of this is still new.  Stay tuned.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other possibilities.  Fertilizing the oceans with iron comes up, but I don't think we understand oceanic ecology well enough.  It would be a bitch to measure progress.  At least with charcoal and trees, we can make good estimates of how much carbon is there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The power plant near my home looked at a pilot plant for extract CO2 from the exhaust stream, and storing it underground.  It looked like a 10% cost in plant efficiency, and a large increase in plant cost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You asked about costs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40562.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;cites cost ranging from 200 to 2000 dollars per acre.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Forest biomass:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0717-forest_carbon.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;cites an average of 377 tons/acre averaged across 18 sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you are willing to wait,  the cost is somewhere between 50 cents and 5 bucks per ton. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the 10% efficiency loss for CO2 separation at the power plant and deep well injection is correct, then since a state of the art coal plant is about 45% efficient, it would increase the cost of power by 45/35.  Your ton of coal produces 240 kWh at 3c or about $7.20  This would raise the price by around $2.  Now the separation process is only about 70% efficient.  (Making it more efficent makes the power plant less so.)  So first order ballpark cost is around $3 per ton of carbon.  It would be lower for natural gas and oil fired plants since they get more energy per ton of carbon.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The charcoal sequesterization, if a workable system can be made, actually MAKES money.  Many crops produce enough residual plant matter that what to do with it is an issue.  Not all of it can be used for feed, and all too often growers will bale it just to get it off their field.  Significant amounts are burned in outside furnaces to provide heat for livestock sheds, shops, etc.  It *should* be a simple redesign to make charcoal makers, which would get only half the heat per bale, but produces charcoal as a byproduct.  The farmer wins with more productive fields as he works this into his land, mostly showing up as decreased fertilizer cost, fewer crop failures, and higher production -- maybe.  Quantifying this is difficult to impossible because we are at the cutting edge of soil science with carbon.  It will also be a tough initial sell.  I would expect a charcoal maker to be 2-4 times as expensive to make as a bale burner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a process that will work with a lot of municipal waste too that would otherwise fill landfills.

Transport:  Most of the weight in transported food is water.  A truckload of carrots is going to cost close to the same as a truckload of hamburger.  A vegetarian diet tends to have a *lot* more fiber in it.  I would expect that a such a diet would result in increased transport.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Range vs feedlot.  Feedlot beef obviously has all the vegy costs plus all the meat costs.  Range fed meat is often done on land that is not suitable for farming, either because of terrain (too steep, rocky) or climate (too dry, too wet, too cold)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  As a lead in to the GHG component, look at the conversion ratios -- how many pounds of feed does it take to produce a pound of meat?  Pigs are between chickens and cows.  Rabbits and guinea pigs are better than chickens.  Cows in particular produce methane in large quantities, but I suspect that all animals that can digest cellulose will do the same.  Methane has a residence time of about a century in the atmosphere, so while it is a greenhouse gas, it is not here forever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;World Vs.

Most of the disolved minerals are present in very small numbers.  You are going to have to process cubic km of water.  I suspect that the only way to do this economically is to develop materials that bind to a particular atom or ion, coat fabric with it, and let the currents go past it.  For perspective the larger open pit mines have total volumes measured in a small number of cubic kilometers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Factor 2:  To gather material at a level that would make a measurable decrease in the mineral content, you would have to process a measurable fraction of the ocean.  Suppose that you decided to mine the Gulf stream.  So you intercept a 300 km wide strip of ocean 100 m deep.  The gulf stream moves at about 4 mph -- 6 kph say.  So your system will intercept 180 cubic kilometers of water per hour.  At that rate it would take you 7 million hours (about 8 centuries) to process the entire ocean once.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Factor 3:  Replenishment processes.  Most minerals are not close to saturation.  Common salt, the most common mineral, is present at about 3%.  Saturation for salt is about 30%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There will be some exchange between sea floor sediment, but this is going to be VERY slow.   Turnover times for the abyssal plain are on the order of 10,000 years.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suspect that the primary replenishment processes will be geological -- erosion.  If this is correct, then you would do far better by filtering the rivers as they flow to the sea, mining our cities sewage (meta content thousands of times higher than in sea water)  ANY technology that can extract useful minerals out of sea water can extract them out of any liquid waste stream, with likely far greater efficiency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Intercepting significant amounts of an ocean current will have climate effects.  People in nothern Europe will NOT be pleased with you if you slow down the Gulf stream by 10%  Slowing it down, also means that the temperature differential between the tropics and the pole will increase giving greater potential energy to hurricanes.  You just picked up another hate group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Caveats:  Even now vacuuming up manganese nodules off the ocean floor is worth while.  There are likely conditons that have concentrated other minerals in sea floor sediments.  But I didn't understand this to be the type of mining you meant." />

This seems really high.  The UN FAO put the figure at 18%, but report cited above includes respiration, land use change, undercounted methane, increased meat consumption between the dates of the reports (2002 and 2009), and several other smaller factors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I couldn't find an emissions per calorie figure for the globe, however, the ratios probably aren't too different from above.  What's important at the global scale is meat consumption now stands at 322 g/day/capita in the US.  The global figure is 115 g/day/capita.  That means the world outside of the US is relatively vegetarian.  However, as incomes climb, consumers eat more meat (though at a diminishing rate).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, the world is shifting towards a more meat dense diet and thereby raising food emissions significantly (stats above from [UNEP GHG Emissions Associated with Meat Production](http://www.unep.org/pdf/UNEP-GEAS_OCT_2012.pdf).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Vegetarianism vs Locavorism**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[A paper from Environmental Science and Technology](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es702969f#), which earned ACS honors for top paper in environmental policy, claims that 83% of food emissions are in production - only 11% of lifecycle emissions are caused by transportation. They conclude:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Shifting away from red meat, especially to a vegetarian diet, is a stronger lever towards reducing GHG emissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Importance of Livestock Feed**&#xD;&#xA;This could actually be pretty significant for beef.

What is likely to happen is that oil prices will continue to rise, until it gets to the point where it's economically advantageous to invest more significantly in alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Why we're not going to run out of oil (soon)...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we talk about how much oil is &quot;left&quot;, we're typically talking about _recoverable_ oil. There's a lot of oil in places that we can't easily reach right now. As oil reserves are consumed, the price of oil increases (simple supply and demand). Counter-intuitively, as the price of oil increases, the amount of oil reserves has historically _increased_.  This is because the oil that was previously not considered recoverable can now be extracted because drilling technology has advanced and the higher price-per-barrel makes it more economical to extract that hard-to-reach oil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, the more oil we use, the more the price of oil increases, and the more oil we can afford to extract at the new, higher prices. We're now seeing production of oil from tar sands, which is much more difficult and expensive than extraction from a conventional well. We will continue to see production of harder (and more expensive) to reach oil reserves as the price increases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, when drilling for oil, not all of the oil is actually extracted. The faster you extract oil the less you get out, and it's never possible to extract _all_ of the oil. This is referred to as the upper technically recoverable and economically recoverable amount, and gives the probability of extracting a particular volume of oil from a certain oil field. This image shows a generic example, showing the difference between what's _possible_ to recover and what's _economical_ to recover:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![oil recoverability curve][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As it becomes increasingly difficult to find new oil sources, I expect we will see advancements in technology (and in the amount of money oil companies are willing to invest) to go back to &quot;finished&quot; wells and extract oil that wasn't previously extractable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now obviously, oil is a finite resource. It will technically run out eventually, but it won't be like hitting a brick wall. It'll be an overall increase in cost and decrease in availability over the next 20, 50, maybe 100-200 years. Depending on who you ask, there are about 0.8-1.5 trillion barrels of recoverable oil left in conventional reserves worldwide&lt;sup&gt;([1][3])&lt;/sup&gt;. At a current consumption rate of about 90 million barrels of oil per day&lt;sup&gt;([2][4])&lt;/sup&gt;, that would put us right about at 30 years before current reserves run out. _But_, that doesn't take into account unconventional sources, future advancements in extraction technology, and the production in the future of sources not presently considered recoverable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![world oil supply chart][5]][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What are the alternatives for energy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you said, petroleum does seem the most likely to disappear, or at least become economically unfeasible to continue using the soonest. Coal and natural gas are the other major fossil fuels, and we have quite a bit of both. From a sustainability perspective, natural gas is preferable to oil and coal: it's relatively clean to burn from an air pollution perspective, and while still emitting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when burned, it does emit less carbon than other fossil fuel sources. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have quite a bit of natural gas and coal left - especially coal. The US Energy Information Administration estimates there are about 483 billion short tons of coal reserves in the US alone&lt;sup&gt;([3][7])&lt;/sup&gt;. In terms of raw energy content, that's the equivalent of about 2 trillion barrels of oil&lt;sup&gt;([4][8])&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the US has at least twice as much energy in coal as the whole world does in oil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coal is obviously unsustainable. It's a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and the extraction process is environmentally devastating. You're right that we won't run out of coal anytime soon, but it's not a good alternative to oil (although [coal liquifaction][9] is a real technology that we may see more of in the future).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We really don't need to use oil for electricity or heat generation. Other technologies are much better for those tasks. It's very difficult to replace oil for transportation though, because almost nothing is as energy dense and portable as petroleum products. Biofuels have the potential to _help_, but have their own sustainability challenges and often use more fossil fuels in the production process than they save. Next-generation biofuels based on cellulosic feedstocks and microbial/algal production have potential as well, but it is unlikely that we'll replace our entire petroleum-based transportation system with biofuels - we simply don't have the land to do it. Battery technology is improving, and we'll likely see a gradual shift to electric vehicles as they become more practical. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think there will also be some necessary lifestyle changes to move away from oil as a transportation fuel. There will come a point - be it sooner or later - when petroleum is simply too expensive for us to continue our current lifestyle without changes. Whether the change is to electric vehicles, greater use of public transportation, more active transit (walking, biking, etc.) or something else is something we have yet to see.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What are the alternatives for plastics?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not a plastics expert, although I am friends with a few. We can make plastics from plants, and have been for some time - those biodegradable plastics you see sometimes are made from corn. Bio-plastics are an up-and-coming research area, but as with energy, we won't be able to keep up our current level of consumption with bio-replacements alone. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Plastics recycling is a tricky situation right now, and we're going to see a lot more recycling in the near future. Companies have developed technology that can take waste plastics (unsorted of any type) and break them back down into crude oil to be reprocessed&lt;sup&gt;[(5)][10]&lt;/sup&gt;. This avoids the hassle of separating plastic types (which is a major disincentive for recycling in the eyes of many people today), and provides greater flexibility for the end product. A combination of bio-plastics and plastics recycling may help alleviate these problems in the future, but plastics likely will get more expensive at some point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6bZV3.gif&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-0028-01/fs-0028-01.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2178rank.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/report/global_oil.cfm&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/aPHD6.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/report/global_oil.cfm&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.eia.gov/coal/reserves/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28coal%20energy%20content%20*%20483%20billion%20short%20tons%29%20/%20BOE&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_liquefaction&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://www.agilyx.com/our-technology/" />

Anyone wanting to add waste generation and other considerations please feel free. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chad is right that the question depends first on how your kids live and where you decide to live. Geography and economy are very important variables.  A study by [Chris Jones](http://www.stanford.edu/group/peec/cgi-bin/docs/events/2009/becc/presentations/1F%20Jones%20BECC%20Final.pdf) at UC Berkeley broke the average carbon footprints of the US and world as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080428120658.htm) has the total figures as 20 and 4 tons for the US and world respectively.  I suggest this has to do with Jones accounting of indirect supply chain emissions he calculated using [lifecycle input output analysis](http://www.eiolca.net/), so I tend to trust his figures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A [paper Jones published](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es102221h) in Environmental Science and Technology showed, using the same methodologies, that these distributions can vary substantially.  For instance, a comparison of San Francisco vs St. Louis showed the following differences:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - transportation emissions 2x as high in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA; - housing emissions over 2x as high in SL compared to SF&#xD;&#xA; - food emissions twice as high in SL compared to SF&#xD;&#xA; - goods emissions ~30% higher in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA; - service emissions ~40% higher in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because I'm not sure which locations you are choosing between, I can't say what categories will be most important to you, so I'll use the average US case.  Based on Jones' analysis we see that transportation, electricity and heating are good place to start to look at reducing your carbon impact.  The first consideration you should therefore make is your traveling habits at the two different places:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - As a retired person will you be traveling on vacation a lot?  Using&#xD;&#xA;   [EPA Climate Leaders'](http://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/documents/resources/commute_travel_product.pdf) figures, we can crudely estimate that a 6000 mi flight * .185 kg / passenger-mi results in over one metric ton of direct CO2 emissions - roughly 10% of the average American's direct transportation emissions - not insignificant.&#xD;&#xA; - what will your daily commute look like?  If you're staying at home wiping the grand kids' ass then score some points for sustainability!  However, if you are going to need to drive your car for entertainment, volunteering, work in either situation, you'll need to exploit opportunities to carpool or use a low emission vehicle (think electric with solar).&#xD;&#xA; - what will the building situation look like?  If you can't directly compare electric and heating bills, consider the natural lighting, the climate (a more extreme climate leads to increased HVAC loads), insulation and air leakiness of the house.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now more specific to your question, let's hold these factors constant and just consider how adding an additional person to a house can contribute to sustainability.  Every four years the EIA conducts a [residential energy consumer survey](http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption#summary).  Now here is some data I love and think would be very interesting to you  (there is a bunch of other great stuff in there for any data junkies):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are substantial energy savings from increasing the number of members per household. However *there are diminishing returns* to adding another member to the house.  So the first person would contribute 30% per capita energy savings, the second 20%, the third 10%.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's say you are considering a two person house vs a six person house.  Moving into the two person house, you would be responsible for 50% of the 2-person house's primary energy (45 MBtu).  If you were the sixth person in a five person house, you would be responsible for 4MBtu margin of going from 5 person to six person house.  **A huge difference!**  These gains are mostly from shared energy sources, such as a refrigerator, shared lighting, shared air temperature etc.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Obviously energy consumption is very different outside US, but the principles should hold. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ipXsv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/blWi7.png" />

So far. For good reason. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, it's worth noting that out whole existent infrastructure worldwide is based on such a system. You may need to refine your assumptions or conditions to eliminate some aspects which are not desired.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All energy sources that we can access are in some manner area based on &quot;star stuff&quot; at root. Our own Star &quot;Sol&quot; drives wind, hydro, PV, solar thermal, coal and more. Other stars have sourced radioactives. Everything above iron appears to have come from Supernovae. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One  obvious questionable point is the use of hydrocarbons obtained by &quot;mining&quot; in some way or another (drill, dig, Frac ...). These energy sources are repositories of stored solar energy - but &quot;we&quot; did not do the storing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another questionable source is radioactives. These also are &quot;star stuff&quot; - but not from our current nearby Star. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A system could be devised that adds to its energy wealth without use of hydrocarbon energy or radioactives except for the getting-going phase but it would be a close fought thing. There are many who argue that there is no net energy gain available in current systems such as biomass where long term energy out is said not to match total system wide energy expenditure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole of life energy cost of a product can be VERY roughly approximated by expressing its best available initial cost in energy cost terms. eg you can buy PV solar material in vast volume in China for approaching $US0.10/Watt_mp and whole made up panels at around $US0.50 ex factory. This must be more than the cost energy of fabrication IF government or other subsidies are not present. In fact, Chinese solar manufacturing is crucially dependant on state subsidy at present so overall it is likely that PV panels bought in vast volume cost around the energy cost of production - and that the lifetime energy available from these systems will be somewhat higher than this but not vastly so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If any one energy source was vastly more cost effective it would dominate world markets and displace alternatives. At present coal, hydro, geothermal are king, nuclear is a special case and the &quot;wannabees&quot; are wind &amp; waves (both a form of solar) and PV &amp; thermal solar. I say nuclear is a special case as all insurance risk has always been underwritten by governments in all installations anywhere, no private insurer will tough the market with a triple length barge pole and in an open market the product could not be sold, no matter how &quot;truly safe&quot; it was. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While wind and various solar sources are being used in competition with traditional sources they are invariably assisted by various special tariffs or market distortions or enforced special rates or conditions. Its still hard to compete head on with energetic gooey stuff found for free (initially) in the ground. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, so far, if you can build an escalating self-replicating infrastructure with traditional energy sources, then you can probably do so with &quot;alternate&quot; sources, but it will be harder, or much harder. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__________________&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;While it is a work of fiction, Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy + &quot;Red Mars&quot;, &quot;Green Mars&quot;, Blue Mars&quot; contains many ideas in the ability to build a world starting with small seed input. He use nuclear, solar, thermal and more on a grand scale. A very worthwhile read from many perspectives." />

It doesn't make sense at the moment - it's an excessively complex way of doing things. High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) losses are low over long-distances, and it's a much simpler, more reliable technology. Their target isn't that ambitious - 100GW of capacity in 30 years: the world did that in (about) the last ten years, and is likely to do the same in fewer than the next 5 years - the plan is to get to [300GW of new capacity per year by 2025][7].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's a useful experiment to prove the concept.

A very worthwhile read from many perspectives.&#xD;&#xA;________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Added Q&amp;A:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Q: Energy numbers asked:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If I've read this correctly, you're claiming that the economics implies that PV has an EROEI of only just above 1, or below it. And in comparing wind with fossil fuel subsidies, you've ignored the subsidies and externalities of fossil fuels. Have I understood correctly? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A:** @EnergyNumbers Close enough, alas. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can add in fossil fuel etc subsidies as may esist if you wish, but on a level playing field the raw concentrated &amp; stored energy of petroleum makes it hard to compete with. The cost of petroleum is essentially extraction + transport + refining + profit + taxes. You do not largely need to &quot;interact&quot; with the energy source per se and the energy per volume is high these both  make the job cheaper and easier. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've added to my answer above with some rough figures for solar. The &quot;trouble&quot; with existing energy sources is that we have tapped the obvious easy ones. Liquid hydrocarbons (petrol, diesel, kerosine) give around 10 kWh/kg or say about 2.5 kWh/kg delivered energy in an internal combustion engine system. Coal delivers lower energy/kg but is still extremely energy dense compared to non chemical-stored-energy alternatives.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Falling mass (water or whatever) delivers 10 Watt.seconds per kg.metre     &#xD;&#xA;But to equal the delivered energy from 1 kg of hydrocarbon takes  &#xD;&#xA;2500 Watt hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 9,000,000 Watt seconds !!! of energy.  &#xD;&#xA;This takes 900 ton.metres of falling mass at 100%. ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put another way   &#xD;&#xA;1 ton = 1000 kg falling 10 metres   &#xD;&#xA;delivers 100,000 Watt.seconds = 27.777.. Watt hours of energy.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or 1 kg/second falling 10 metres in one second   &#xD;&#xA;delivers 100 Watts at 100% efficient,   &#xD;&#xA;but do that for one hour = 36,000 litres or 36 tons of water to get about 1% of the energy in 1 kg of petroleum (or 4% of delivered energy in auto use). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AND hydro is &quot;easy and cheap&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;We know that PV needs subsidies / FITs etc to compete.   &#xD;&#xA;And that eg the Chinese government are essentially subsidising ALL the still surviving Chinese PV makers makers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;problem&quot; is that we value energy at the hydrocarbon equivalent value to our society and until we are willing to bite the &quot;pay what it really costs&quot; bullet alternatives will remain marginal or of negative value. Alas. &#xD;&#xA;[[FWIW: I design/make small solar products, manufactured in China (at present) for developing country use. So I watch what solar and similar costs and where it is going. So, sometime. But not yet. Despite what the downvoter may think :-). ]].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that people in the US who cover their roof with PV usually are happy with the payback. The feed in tariffs, purchase subsidies and lack of costed labor for eg panel cleaning, mean that they may get $ for $ break even in the 5 to 10 years range.But add some discounted cash flow cost-of money calculations and take away the various subsidies (including those by the Chinese government) and you find that PV are at best fighting neck and neck with traditional systems when areas of good sunshine are available, or losing out in real terms. &#xD;&#xA;" />

Permaculturalists also eat the young leaves cooked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think yield of nuts is the only issue.  The other issues must include long-term soil issues and the like.  While higher yields can in theory support larger populations, that's only one long-term variable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, nuts are probably more sustainable as a class than beans because beans are typically grown as pioneer species on disturbed soil while nots are grown as longish term trees.  While beans fix nitrogen, the fact that they are pioneer species works against them in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short there are a very large number of variables.  Some that I think you should consider are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  How useful are the rest of the parts of the tree?  With cashews, the &quot;apples&quot; can be cooked and eaten (mildly astringent fruit resembling the Indonesian jambu air).  with walnuts, the wood is useful  We don't use as much hazelwood as we used to (it's good for bows and for tally sticks).  And so forth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  What is the impact long-term on the soil as it is typically grown?  How much fertilizer goes in?  How much in the way of pesticides?  This is a real issue and it may differ so much from region to region that it makes a clear comparison difficult.  In general organically grown nuts as a class will do better than non-organic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  What is the embodied energy of the labor?  Does it require a lot of migrant labor which comes in via car and moves around (in small groups by car) around a large area every year?  Or does it support more sendantary labor?  Tropical nuts will do better than temperate nuts in this regard, but....&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4.  Are you growing them yourself?

So far. For good reason.   &#xD;&#xA;They MAY come. but not soon, and not easily.   &#xD;&#xA; BUT energy production as a whole is potentially moving towards the model suggested in the question. Whether it gets there depends on many factors ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As much as we all may like to see a numerous and increasing number of &quot;breeder&quot; projects the reality so far is that the only ones that appear to exist turn out to so far be only theoretical and &quot;on paper&quot;. Their day is yet to come.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall such systems do exist on a larger scale but they are interleaved through industry as a whole. That is, rather than having identifiable stand alone systems that self-grow we instead have an industrial society whose energy production capability is increasing and which uses its own energy production to drive this increase. So far this increase is driven by energy from mixed sources - both renewable and non renewable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The prospect of renewable energy sources providing an increasing proportion of total energy production - and so approaching the ideal suggested by the questioner, increases with time due to eg &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - As our capabilities grow the ability to get more energy per land area from windfarms, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Increasing efficiencies from solar photovoltaic while using thinner lower material content PV cells. (eg until recently state of the art industrial PV crystalline silicon panels were about 18% efficient but recent back contact cells with improved antireflective methods have resulted in 23%+ efficient commercially available PV cells. Efficiency improvement allows higher energy per area, less maintenance costs from eg cleaning, better land utilisation. Silicon material availability is not usually a primary issue but thinner cells improve yields and allow new variants such as flexible crystalline silicon - double side irradiation etc.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Longer life higher efficiency solar thermal plants with eg molten salt heat storage to extend operating hours per day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Commercialisation of dish-Stirling systems with best in class efficiencies in excess of that so far achievable by solar PV. (Commercially viable Solar dish Stirling has been  a decades long journey which even now is at the marginal stage. )&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these and others will slowly push up the the potential proportion of renewable energy in the global energy mix. However, the massive increasaes in petroleum availability on the last decade or so due to &quot;Fracking&quot; developments and the incipient potential for eg coal recovery by fluid flow methods and the massive potential for deep sea Methane Hydrate recovery also means that the renewable proportion of total energy produced may fall.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Breeder reactor methods, and the long long long proposed Thorium [Pebble Bed reactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor)  technology while not fully renewable, greatly increases nuclearfuel utilisation. Thorium PBRs notionally have energy production costs &quot;far less than coal&quot;. That claim somehow sounds strangely familiar :-).   &#xD;&#xA;See refs at end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What about the &quot;Sahara Solar Breeder project&quot;**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Sadly, while [The Sahara Solar Breeder Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Solar_Breeder_Project) is a grand idea that may yet produce some concrete results, so far, it's very largely a pipe dream and research project between some Japanese and Algerian universities. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; A look at the rather empty Wikipedia page (link above) is not too encouraging.  &#xD;&#xA; The [**Sahara Solar Breeder Foundation**](http://www.ssb-foundation.com/) **official website** has more pictures and desriptions, but nothing obviously new (2010 copyright date) and has a now passed 1st prototype date with no indication that anything has actually been builyt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A system could be devised that adds to its energy wealth without use of hydrocarbon energy or radioactives except for the getting-going phase but all avaible studies, and all experience to date with alternative energy, suggest that it would be a close fought thing. There are many who argue that there is no net energy gain available in current alternative energy systems such as biomass where long term energy out is said not to match total system wide energy expenditure. eg for biomass energy is expended on planting, harvesting, transportation, processing, storage, waste disposal etc. To make biomass products such as transport alcohol viable subsidies are usually required. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's worth noting carefully that all energy sources that we can access are in some manner area based on &quot;star stuff&quot; at root. Our own Star &quot;Sol&quot; drives wind, hydro, PV, solar thermal, coal and more. Other stars have sourced radioactives. Everything above iron appears to have come from Supernovae. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also worth noting that that out whole existent infrastructure worldwide is already based on a solar driven breeder system. You may need to refine your assumptions or conditions to eliminate some aspects which are not desired.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - One  obvious questionable point is the use of hydrocarbons obtained by &quot;mining&quot; in some way or another (drill, dig, Frac ...). These energy sources are repositories of stored solar energy - but &quot;we&quot; did not do the storing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Another questionable source is radioactives. These also are &quot;star stuff&quot; - but not from our current nearby Star. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole of life energy cost of a product can be VERY roughly approximated by expressing its best available initial cost in energy cost terms. eg you can buy PV solar material in vast volume in China for approaching $US0.10/Watt_mp and whole made up panels at around $US0.50 ex factory. This must be more than the cost energy of fabrication IF government or other subsidies are not present. In fact, Chinese solar manufacturing is crucially dependant on state subsidy at present so overall it is likely that PV panels bought in vast volume cost around or even slightly less than the energy cost of production - and that the lifetime energy available from these systems will be somewhat higher than this but not vastly so.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_____________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A look at real world solar PV realities is not encouraging. eg  1000 Wmp of PV panels costs about $US400 FOB factory at present in large volume.   &#xD;&#xA;The installed cost of such a sytem in a &quot;western location&quot; is around $1/Watt mp.  &#xD;&#xA; In a good location mean daily output is about 4 kWh and for a say 20 year design life total energy produced = 4 kWh x 365 days x 20 years =~ 30 MWh.  AT $US0.10 wholesale / kWh that's $2920 of electricity for $1000 of installed panel cost over 20 years. At first glance that's a win. However, if you include &quot;cost of money&quot; = which you must, then a simple DCF calculation suggests about $1960 at 5%, $1400 at 10% and $1100 at 15%.&#xD;&#xA;At $1/Wmp installed break even is barely reached at 15% - a rate that international financiers of large risky project are liable to expect. Even at 5% the profit of about $900/kW of panels is required to also fund maintenance, cleaning. a significant factor, any early failures and decommissioning. $900 is $45 / year per kW of panels including any profit. That's about 6 square metres of panel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If any one energy source was vastly more cost effective it would dominate world markets and displace alternatives. At present coal, hydro, geothermal are king, nuclear is a special case and the &quot;wannabees&quot; are wind &amp; waves (both a form of solar) and PV &amp; thermal solar. I say nuclear is a special case as all insurance risk has always been underwritten by governments in all installations anywhere, no private insurer will tough the market with a triple length barge pole and in an open market the product could not be sold, no matter how &quot;truly safe&quot; it was. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While wind and various solar sources are being used in competition with traditional sources they are invariably assisted by various special tariffs or market distortions or enforced special rates or conditions. Its still hard to compete head on with energetic gooey stuff found for free (initially) in the ground. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, so far, if you can build an escalating self-replicating infrastructure with traditional energy sources, then you can probably do so with &quot;alternate&quot; sources, but it will be harder, or much harder. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__________________&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;While it is a work of fiction, Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy + &quot;Red Mars&quot;, &quot;Green Mars&quot;, Blue Mars&quot; contains many ideas in the ability to build a world starting with small seed input. He use nuclear, solar, thermal and more on a grand scale. A very worthwhile read from many perspectives.&#xD;&#xA;________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Added Q&amp;A:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Q: Energy numbers asked:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If I've read this correctly, you're claiming that the economics implies that PV has an EROEI of only just above 1, or below it. And in comparing wind with fossil fuel subsidies, you've ignored the subsidies and externalities of fossil fuels. Have I understood correctly? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A:** @EnergyNumbers Close enough, alas. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can add in fossil fuel etc subsidies as may esist if you wish, but on a level playing field the raw concentrated &amp; stored energy of petroleum makes it hard to compete with. The cost of petroleum is essentially extraction + transport + refining + profit + taxes. You do not largely need to &quot;interact&quot; with the energy source per se and the energy per volume is high these both  make the job cheaper and easier. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've added to my answer above with some rough figures for solar. The &quot;trouble&quot; with existing energy sources is that we have tapped the obvious easy ones. Liquid hydrocarbons (petrol, diesel, kerosine) give around 10 kWh/kg or say about 2.5 kWh/kg delivered energy in an internal combustion engine system. Coal delivers lower energy/kg but is still extremely energy dense compared to non chemical-stored-energy alternatives.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Falling mass (water or whatever) delivers 10 Watt.seconds per kg.metre     &#xD;&#xA;But to equal the delivered energy from 1 kg of hydrocarbon takes  &#xD;&#xA;2500 Watt hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 9,000,000 Watt seconds !!! of energy.  &#xD;&#xA;This takes 900 ton.metres of falling mass at 100%. ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put another way   &#xD;&#xA;1 ton = 1000 kg falling 10 metres   &#xD;&#xA;delivers 100,000 Watt.seconds = 27.777.. Watt hours of energy.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or 1 kg/second falling 10 metres in one second   &#xD;&#xA;delivers 100 Watts at 100% efficient,   &#xD;&#xA;but do that for one hour = 36,000 litres or 36 tons of water to get about 1% of the energy in 1 kg of petroleum (or 4% of delivered energy in auto use). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AND hydro is &quot;easy and cheap&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;We know that PV needs subsidies / FITs etc to compete.   &#xD;&#xA;And that eg the Chinese government are essentially subsidising ALL the still surviving Chinese PV makers makers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;problem&quot; is that we value energy at the hydrocarbon equivalent value to our society and until we are willing to bite the &quot;pay what it really costs&quot; bullet alternatives will remain marginal or of negative value.

Text="Many in the sanitation treatment industry feel the garbage disposal was among the most troublesome inventions in the history of the modern home.  Treatment facilities are designed to remove bacterial and viral contaminants, not solid wastes (grinding it and sending it into the sewer system does not change the fact that it is solid waste).  Most plants have been retrofitted to remove the increased volume of food waste (among other things), but it is no where near as efficient as composting this waste stream.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, using a garbage disposal is another way to outsource waste removal without paying additionally for it, and it puts an undue burden on infrastructure.  To see this process in action, and to see what happens when food waste is co-mingled with wastewater, I highly recommend taking a tour of your local treatment facility - usually this is a free service provided to citizens.  For example, if you live in southern California, the Orange County Sanitation District and Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts will offer free tours:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Orange County Sanitation District][1]&#xD;&#xA;* [Los Angeles County Sanitation District][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Composting is relatively easy, although it does require a bit of maintenance.  If you have a backyard, outdoor composting is definitely the preferred solution - there are plenty of websites out there that will provide instructions.  If you live in an apartment or have limited space, consider worm composting.  If done properly, there is no odor, and the end product (worm casting &quot;poo&quot;) makes for perfect potting soil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Composting (as above) should only be done with specific kinds of scraps - e.g. fruits, veggies, breads, egg shells, garden cuttings, etc.  Do NOT add fats, oils, meats, or dairy products.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I had never heard of guinea pigs as a disposal method - cool idea! Along those same lines, many people in the U.S. are using chickens to achieve the same goal.  Chickens will eat anything, including meats, fats, dairy products, cooked food, etc!  But check your city or county ordinances to make sure this is approved in your area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ocsd.com/index.aspx?page=115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.lacsd.org/education/tours/default.asp" />

So far. For good reason.   &#xD;&#xA;They MAY come. but not soon, and not easily.   &#xD;&#xA; BUT energy production as a whole is potentially moving towards the model suggested in the question. Whether it gets there depends on many factors ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As much as we all may like to see a numerous and increasing number of &quot;breeder&quot; projects the reality so far is that the only ones that appear to exist turn out to so far be only theoretical and &quot;on paper&quot;. Their day is yet to come.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall such systems do exist on a larger scale but they are interleaved through industry as a whole. That is, rather than having identifiable stand alone systems that self-grow we instead have an industrial society whose energy production capability is increasing and which uses its own energy production to drive this increase. So far this increase is driven by energy from mixed sources - both renewable and non renewable. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The prospect of renewable energy sources providing an increasing proportion of total energy production - and so approaching the ideal suggested by the questioner, increases with time due to eg &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - As our capabilities grow the ability to get more energy per land area from windfarms, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Increasing efficiencies from solar photovoltaic while using thinner lower material content PV cells. (eg until recently state of the art industrial PV crystalline silicon panels were about 18% efficient but recent back contact cells with improved antireflective methods have resulted in 23%+ efficient commercially available PV cells. Efficiency improvement allows higher energy per area, less maintenance costs from eg cleaning, better land utilisation. Silicon material availability is not usually a primary issue but thinner cells improve yields and allow new variants such as flexible crystalline silicon - double side irradiation etc.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Longer life higher efficiency solar thermal plants with eg molten salt heat storage to extend operating hours per day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Commercialisation of dish-Stirling systems with best in class efficiencies in excess of that so far achievable by solar PV. (Commercially viable Solar dish Stirling has been  a decades long journey which even now is at the marginal stage. )&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these and others will slowly push up the the potential proportion of renewable energy in the global energy mix. However, the massive increasaes in petroleum availability on the last decade or so due to &quot;Fracking&quot; developments and the incipient potential for eg coal recovery by fluid flow methods and the massive potential for deep sea Methane Hydrate recovery also means that the renewable proportion of total energy produced may fall.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Breeder reactor methods, and the long long long proposed Thorium [Pebble Bed reactor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor)  technology while not fully renewable, greatly increases nuclearfuel utilisation. Thorium PBRs notionally have energy production costs &quot;far less than coal&quot;. That claim somehow sounds strangely familiar :-).   &#xD;&#xA;See refs at end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What about the &quot;Sahara Solar Breeder project&quot;**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Sadly, while [The Sahara Solar Breeder Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara_Solar_Breeder_Project) is a grand idea that may yet produce some concrete results, so far, it's very largely a pipe dream and research project between some Japanese and Algerian universities. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; A look at the rather empty Wikipedia page (link above) is not too encouraging.  &#xD;&#xA; The [**Sahara Solar Breeder Foundation**](http://www.ssb-foundation.com/) **official website** has more pictures and desriptions, but nothing obviously new (2010 copyright date) and has a now passed 1st prototype date with no indication that anything has actually been builyt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A system could be devised that adds to its energy wealth without use of hydrocarbon energy or radioactives except for the getting-going phase but all avaible studies, and all experience to date with alternative energy, suggest that it would be a close fought thing. There are many who argue that there is no net energy gain available in current alternative energy systems such as biomass where long term energy out is said not to match total system wide energy expenditure. eg for biomass energy is expended on planting, harvesting, transportation, processing, storage, waste disposal etc. To make biomass products such as transport alcohol viable subsidies are usually required. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's worth noting carefully that all energy sources that we can access are in some manner area based on &quot;star stuff&quot; at root. Our own Star &quot;Sol&quot; drives wind, hydro, PV, solar thermal, coal and more. Other stars have sourced radioactives. Everything above iron appears to have come from Supernovae. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also worth noting that that out whole existent infrastructure worldwide is already based on a solar driven breeder system. You may need to refine your assumptions or conditions to eliminate some aspects which are not desired.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - One  obvious questionable point is the use of hydrocarbons obtained by &quot;mining&quot; in some way or another (drill, dig, Frac ...). These energy sources are repositories of stored solar energy - but &quot;we&quot; did not do the storing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Another questionable source is radioactives. These also are &quot;star stuff&quot; - but not from our current nearby Star. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole of life energy cost of a product can be VERY roughly approximated by expressing its best available initial cost in energy cost terms. eg you can buy PV solar material in vast volume in China for approaching $US0.10/Watt_mp and whole made up panels at around $US0.50 ex factory. This must be more than the cost energy of fabrication IF government or other subsidies are not present. In fact, Chinese solar manufacturing is crucially dependant on state subsidy at present so overall it is likely that PV panels bought in vast volume cost around or even slightly less than the energy cost of production - and that the lifetime energy available from these systems will be somewhat higher than this but not vastly so.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_____________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A look at real world solar PV realities is not encouraging. eg  1000 Wmp of PV panels costs about $US400 FOB factory at present in large volume.   &#xD;&#xA;The installed cost of such a sytem in a &quot;western location&quot; is around $1/Watt mp.  &#xD;&#xA; In a good location mean daily output is about 4 kWh and for a say 20 year design life total energy produced = 4 kWh x 365 days x 20 years =~ 30 MWh.  AT $US0.10 wholesale / kWh that's $2920 of electricity for $1000 of installed panel cost over 20 years. At first glance that's a win. However, if you include &quot;cost of money&quot; = which you must, then a simple DCF calculation suggests about $1960 at 5%, $1400 at 10% and $1100 at 15%.&#xD;&#xA;At $1/Wmp installed break even is barely reached at 15% - a rate that international financiers of large risky project are liable to expect. Even at 5% the profit of about $900/kW of panels is required to also fund maintenance, cleaning. a significant factor, any early failures and decommissioning. $900 is $45 / year per kW of panels including any profit. That's about 6 square metres of panel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If any one energy source was vastly more cost effective it would dominate world markets and displace alternatives. At present coal, hydro, geothermal are king, nuclear is a special case and the &quot;wannabees&quot; are wind &amp; waves (both a form of solar) and PV &amp; thermal solar. I say nuclear is a special case as all insurance risk has always been underwritten by governments in all installations anywhere, no private insurer will tough the market with a triple length barge pole and in an open market the product could not be sold, no matter how &quot;truly safe&quot; it was. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While wind and various solar sources are being used in competition with traditional sources they are invariably assisted by various special tariffs or market distortions or enforced special rates or conditions. Its still hard to compete head on with energetic gooey stuff found for free (initially) in the ground. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, so far, if you can build an escalating self-replicating infrastructure with traditional energy sources, then you can probably do so with &quot;alternate&quot; sources, but it will be harder, or much harder. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__________________&#xD;&#xA;	&#xD;&#xA;While it is a work of fiction, Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy + &quot;Red Mars&quot;, &quot;Green Mars&quot;, Blue Mars&quot; contains many ideas in the ability to build a world starting with small seed input. He use nuclear, solar, thermal and more on a grand scale. A very worthwhile read from many perspectives.&#xD;&#xA;________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Added Q&amp;A:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Q: Energy numbers asked:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If I've read this correctly, you're claiming that the economics implies that PV has an EROEI of only just above 1, or below it. And in comparing wind with fossil fuel subsidies, you've ignored the subsidies and externalities of fossil fuels. Have I understood correctly? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A:** @EnergyNumbers Close enough, alas. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can add in fossil fuel etc subsidies as may esist if you wish, but on a level playing field the raw concentrated &amp; stored energy of petroleum makes it hard to compete with. The cost of petroleum is essentially extraction + transport + refining + profit + taxes. You do not largely need to &quot;interact&quot; with the energy source per se and the energy per volume is high these both  make the job cheaper and easier. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've added to my answer above with some rough figures for solar. The &quot;trouble&quot; with existing energy sources is that we have tapped the obvious easy ones. Liquid hydrocarbons (petrol, diesel, kerosine) give around 10 kWh/kg or say about 2.5 kWh/kg delivered energy in an internal combustion engine system. Coal delivers lower energy/kg but is still extremely energy dense compared to non chemical-stored-energy alternatives.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Falling mass (water or whatever) delivers 10 Watt.seconds per kg.metre     &#xD;&#xA;But to equal the delivered energy from 1 kg of hydrocarbon takes  &#xD;&#xA;2500 Watt hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 9,000,000 Watt seconds !!! of energy.  &#xD;&#xA;This takes 900 ton.metres of falling mass at 100%. ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put another way   &#xD;&#xA;1 ton = 1000 kg falling 10 metres   &#xD;&#xA;delivers 100,000 Watt.seconds = 27.777.. Watt hours of energy.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or 1 kg/second falling 10 metres in one second   &#xD;&#xA;delivers 100 Watts at 100% efficient,   &#xD;&#xA;but do that for one hour = 36,000 litres or 36 tons of water to get about 1% of the energy in 1 kg of petroleum (or 4% of delivered energy in auto use). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AND hydro is &quot;easy and cheap&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;We know that PV needs subsidies / FITs etc to compete.   &#xD;&#xA;And that eg the Chinese government are essentially subsidising ALL the still surviving Chinese PV makers makers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;problem&quot; is that we value energy at the hydrocarbon equivalent value to our society and until we are willing to bite the &quot;pay what it really costs&quot; bullet alternatives will remain marginal or of negative value. Alas. &#xD;&#xA;[[FWIW: I design/make small solar products, manufactured in China (at present) for developing country use. So I watch what solar and similar costs and where it is going. So, sometime. But not yet. Despite what the downvoter may think :-). ]].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that people in the US who cover their roof with PV usually are happy with the payback. The feed in tariffs, purchase subsidies and lack of costed labor for eg panel cleaning, mean that they may get $ for $ break even in the 5 to 10 years range.But add some discounted cash flow cost-of money calculations and take away the various subsidies (including those by the Chinese government) and you find that PV are at best fighting neck and neck with traditional systems when areas of good sunshine are available, or losing out in real terms. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Thorium Pebble Bed - &quot;not quite renewable /  cheaper than coal** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor  &#xD;&#xA;http://pebblebedreactor.blogspot.co.nz/           http://www.thoriumenergycheaperthancoal.com/  &#xD;&#xA;[Norway 4 year Thorium power trial](http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/11/norway-begins-four-year-test-of-thorium-nuclear-reactor/)    &#xD;&#xA;[China Thorium power ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9784044/China-blazes-trail-for-clean-nuclear-power-from-thorium.html)    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Thorium Pebble Bed](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=thorium+reactor&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-rpeUdHXFdGyiQf0moHAAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFwQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=720#hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=thorium+reactor+pebble+bed&amp;oq=thorium+reactor+pebble+bed&amp;gs_l=img.3...226776.229953.0.230188.11.11.0.0.0.0.248.1691.5j0j6.11.0...0.0...1c.1.8.img.JXE6k3-ayZQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44770516,d.aGc&amp;fp=80a3200bb8b7bcb6&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=720)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[More ...](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75393281/Pebble-Bed-Reactors-for-Once-Trough-Nuclear-Transmutation)  &#xD;&#xA;[Coal power station + thorium PBR + CO2 capture](http://coal2nuclear.com/ss_skyscrubber_pilot.htm)  &#xD;&#xA;[More ...](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/68006457/The-Pebble-Bed-Modular-Reactor)  &#xD;&#xA;[ANTI-Thrium argument5s](http://www.independentaustralia.net/2013/environment/dont-believe-thorium-nuclear-reactor-hype/)  &#xD;&#xA;[A nuclear reactor in every home](http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2006/10/a-nuclear-reactor-in-every-home/) Hookey Walker   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Moreover, leather and cotton can't be thrown in a recycle, and I'm not sure which of the above rubber materials are recyclable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two possible ways to break down this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - It seems unlikely, but do any vendors take shoes and reuse the material in new shoes or otherwise?&#xD;&#xA; - what are the best ways to dispose the main shoe materials mentioned above?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, if anyone recommends a manufacturer that make shoes designed to be sustainably disposed, I'd be interested.  However, nothing that will aggravate knee or foot pain.  I'm mostly interested in how to dispose your everyday Nike, Pumas, etc" />

Text="The first (likely) commercial scale coal ccs plant is scheduled to begin operation at Boundary Dam in Canada by the end of the first quarter of 2014 ([Estevan Mercury](http://www.estevanmercury.ca/article/20111222/ESTMERCURY0101/111229984/-1/estmercury/co2-stripper-rolls-into-boundary-dam)).  A few key points about the project:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Plant owner [Sask Power](http://www.saskpowercarboncapture.com/index) will not be building a new plant.  They will retrofit one of their coal plant's 130 MW combustion units.&#xD;&#xA; - they estimate the project will reduce the plant's emissions by 90%-95%.&#xD;&#xA; - the CO2 stripper will use amine solvents to capture the CO2.  I couldn't find any additional tech specs on the stripper.  However, it seems likely that they are savvy to [potential efficiency gains](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es302513j?mi=sijcbk&amp;af=R&amp;pageSize=20&amp;abstract=nmr) researched at the Laval U of Quebec in fall 2012.  &#xD;&#xA; - the Canadian government is investing $240 million in the $1.24B project ([zeroco2.no](http://www.zeroco2.no/projects/saskpowers-boundary-dam-power-station-pilot-plant)).&#xD;&#xA; - most of the CO2 will be sold to operator Cenovous for enhanced oil recovery.  The oil fields will be connected by a 40 mile long pipe (zeroco2.no).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What we see here is a capture project in a location where the captured CO2 will have economic value that won't all be lost by transportation costs, government financial support, and active regional research in CCS.  My questions is where and when will similar circumstances arise in the US?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you could be specific about current or likely government policies (local, state, or federal) and the likely value of captured CO2 (most likely for enhanced oil recovery), that'd be appreciated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also (this may be tangential and a separate question on its own), if you have any insights on the technologies that may obviate the need for government support or high captured CO2 values, I'm definitely interested in that as well.

On a cold but sunny day, the inside of a car can still get very hot, but opening a window just a little bit can reduce the temp to a comfortable level and is unlikely to substantially increase drag, no matter what your speed&#xD;&#xA; 2. On a very humid hot day, opening windows all the way might not cool you down much, despite increasing drag&#xD;&#xA; 3.

Choose comfortable clothing&#xD;&#xA; 2. If the air temperature is reasonably cool, and you're not following a truck belching out stinky fumes, open windows the minimum amount necessary for comfort&#xD;&#xA; 3. If you're still too hot, run the aircon, but reduce the fan speed (if it's manually controlled) to the minimum necessary level for comfort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note the following: In my experience (and this will differ by manufacturer and vehicle age) the temperature setting in most vehicles shows a range from blue to red but the actual function of this setting is to provide a range of heating from none to lots. Don't run your aircon with the temperature setting half way between none and lots, because you're telling the car to heat the air again after you cool it! The one exception to this is when you want to defog your windscreen, where cooling then heating helps dry the air and thus defog more effectively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The 45 mph test consisted of running the tank until it was empty, and showed open windows were more efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Because the original tests were inconclusive, this &quot;urban puzzle&quot; was revisited in episode 38: It is more fuel efficient to use air conditioning when the car is traveling approximately 50mph or more. Otherwise, windows are more fuel efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Episode 38&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; PARTLY CONFIRMED&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The fundamental flaw in the MythBusters’ test was that the point where the drag becomes powerful enough to inhibit a car’s performance with windows down was inside their 45 – 55mph margin at 50mph. Going less than 50mph it is more efficient to leave your windows down, but going greater than 50mph it is more efficient to use your A/C.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sadly unless you have the same vehicle, are driving in the same conditions and have the same comfort requiremennts, this tells you little about your own situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next time you fill up, decide on a strategy and stick to it until your next fill up, then calculate your overall fuel efficiency. Then try a different strategy and see if the efficiency changes. From a series of such tests you can build up a body of empirical evidence about how your own vehicle, preferences and environment interact, and this find out what is most sustainable for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/736/164&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/5661/2772&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://mythbustersresults.com/episode22&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://mythbustersresults.com/episode38" />

Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic refrigerants such as Freon-12® (R-12) were introduced. However, R-12 damaged the ozone layer, causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator#Commercial_and_domestic_refrigerators" />

The question was which would be more sustainable **in the winter**; fresh endive grown locally in a greenhouse, or grown in the ground in Spain (about 1300km from here) and then transport it by truck. According to research they had done the answer was that the endive grown in Spain had a lower CO2 footprint because the local greenhouse requires lots of gas for heating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same television show also mentioned that fresh green beans which are transported by plane (from Kenia) have a far higher CO2 footprint than the ones transported by boat and/or truck (from Senegal, Marocco or Spain), so I guess for all vegetables or fruits it  depends on the method of transportation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Locally grown vegetables that are grown in the summertime, when you don't need a greenhouse, have the lowest CO2 footprint. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For Dutch speakers, here is [the fragment about endive](http://kassa.vara.nl/tv/afspeelpagina/fragment/dilemma-verse-andijvie-uit-nederland-of-uit-spanje/speel/1/) and the one about [green beans](http://kassa.vara.nl/tv/afspeelpagina/fragment/dilemma-sperzieboontjes-uit-afrika/speel/1/)&#xD;&#xA;" />

But I can tell you about one extremely important aspect of frogs that MUST be considered in suburbia. If you want to know what this issue is without reading my context setting and *almost* :-)  relevant preamble, skip to the heading **&quot;Cut to the chase ...&quot;** below. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I live in suburbia in a 1/4 acre jungle &quot;just off&quot; Auckland City. (ie people think that I live at a residential address in a residential street but I really live in a semi jungle :-) ).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have what was an above ground concrete swimming pool about 35 feet x 15 feet, but for many years it's been a home for such wild ducks that wish to visit, or top stay and raise families. We probably get 5 to 15 new families of (wild) ducklings per year. Mallards seem to have claimed the property as their own. We get very rarely a Grey Heron (sorry guy, fish are all gone) and a steady trickle of NZ native birds (Tui, Piwakawaka, occasional Kereru.) But, I (almost) digress :-). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**And**, we have two small goldfish and &quot;lily&quot; ponds. The lilies and goldfish are long gone, victims of the ducks. But we get frogs. Big noisy ones. I don't know how they got here or how they found us. But they seem to like what they have found. During the winter months there is no sign of them. Where they go to and/or how they hide I know not. But, sometime in the spring as the days lengthen and the nights warm, suddenly they are there. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Cut to the chase ...**&#xD;&#xA;How do I know? You can't miss them.   &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Braaaaaaaach. Braaaaaach. Braaaaaaaach.   &#xD;&#xA;... pause ...   &#xD;&#xA;wough wough wough wough wough.   &#xD;&#xA;...

I like the sound.  &#xD;&#xA;I can sleep through almost anything and can roll over and go back to sleep in 5 minutes if woken. My wife can't. Our bedroom is at the front of a largish house. The frog pond is at the rear and then some 30 feet further back again. For the last two years at least they have moved slightly further away again, into the &quot;duck pond&quot; / swimming pool. STILL VERY loud. Still wife waking. They are closer to the neighbours. Pretty grim on occasion, I'm told. Odds are that they may have to go. Quite how you catch large fairly invisible deep pool enshrined frogs I know not. But, I may yet have to find out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I had a vegetable garden instead of a jungle I'd expect that the frogs would be of at least minor benefit and unlikely to be harmful.

Carbon capture technology is a whole other beast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Enhanced Oil Recovery in the US**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to the [DOE](http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/oilgas/eor/), CO2 injection accounts for 60% of all EOR in the US.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; CO2 injection has been used successfully throughout the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and is now being pursued to a limited extent in Kansas, Mississippi, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Colorado, Utah, Montana, Alaska, and Pennsylvania.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of this CO2 has come from naturally occurring reservoirs, but increasingly CO2 is coming from industrial processes, such as NG processing, fertilizer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One demonstration at the Dakota Gasification Company's plant in Beulah, North Dakota is producing CO2 and delivering it by a 204-mile pipeline to the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan, Canada.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to [Dakota Gasification's website](http://www.dakotagas.com/CO2_Capture_and_Storage/index.html), the CO2 is injected for permanent sequestration.  In fact, Cenovus, who signed a 10 year agreement to purchase ~2740 tonnes CO2/day from the Sask Power project above, currently gets 5,500 tons of CO2 per day from North Dakota.  Sask Power CEO claims they can sell their CO2 for **$15-50 per ton** ([Calgary Herald](http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=4af2f49b-831d-4a28-89b6-c8c9b5afc7c7)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Conflicts with Shale Gas**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two maps below show the top 50  largest proved oil reserves in the US and then a map of shale oil and gas formations.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would seem that our largest oil reserves are in Texas, California, and the Northern Great Plains. However, these reserves coincide greatly with shale gas reserves.  According to a [2012 study in Environmental Science and Technology](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es2040015), 80% of US capacity for CO2 geological sequestration (ie deep saline aquifers) exists in shale gas reserves.  Unfortunately, the fracking process undermines the ability of the aquifer to meaningfully sequester the carbon - the CO2 would escape through the tiny cracks used to extract the natural gas.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Active US projects and Government Support**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[sequestration.mit.edu](http://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/antelope_valley.html) has a great database of active and cancelled CCS projects in the US.

It will greatly reduce the amount of heat your house absorbs in the summer, which will reduce the amount of energy you need to cool your home. During the useful life of a modern roof, the energy cost of heat absorbed from sunlight is probably a significant portion of the roof's environmental impact. This is especially important if you live in a hot, sunny climate, but even at 50 degrees N white roofs help more than they hurt. Metal roofs are less effective from this perspective than white roofs, but better than dark roofs. Of course, you could always add a white coating to a metal roof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know anything about sustainable white coatings for roofs, but it's something to look into for the comfort and energy efficiency benefits." />

Anyone wanting to add waste generation and other considerations please feel free. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chad is right that the question depends first on how your kids live and where you decide to live. Geography and economy are very important variables.  A study by [Chris Jones](http://www.stanford.edu/group/peec/cgi-bin/docs/events/2009/becc/presentations/1F%20Jones%20BECC%20Final.pdf) at UC Berkeley broke the average carbon footprints of the US and world as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080428120658.htm) has the total figures as 20 and 4 tons for the US and world respectively.  I suggest this has to do with Jones accounting of indirect supply chain emissions he calculated using [lifecycle input output analysis](http://www.eiolca.net/), so I tend to trust his figures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A [paper Jones published](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es102221h) in Environmental Science and Technology showed, using the same methodologies, that these distributions can vary substantially.  For instance, a comparison of San Francisco vs St. Louis showed the following differences:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - transportation emissions 2x as high in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA; - housing emissions over 2x as high in SL compared to SF&#xD;&#xA; - food emissions twice as high in SL compared to SF&#xD;&#xA; - goods emissions ~30% higher in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA; - service emissions ~40% higher in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because I'm not sure which locations you are choosing between, I can't say what categories will be most important to you, so I'll use the average US case.  Based on Jones' analysis we see that transportation, electricity and heating are good place to start to look at reducing your carbon impact.  The first consideration you should therefore make is your traveling habits at the two different places:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - As a retired person will you be traveling on vacation a lot?  Using&#xD;&#xA;   [EPA Climate Leaders'](http://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/documents/resources/commute_travel_product.pdf) figures, we can crudely estimate that a 6000 mi flight * .185 kg / passenger-mi results in over one metric ton of direct CO2 emissions - roughly 10% of the average American's direct transportation emissions - not insignificant.&#xD;&#xA; - what will your daily commute look like?  If you're staying at home wiping the grand kids' ass then score some points for sustainability!  However, if you are going to need to drive your car for entertainment, volunteering, work in either situation, you'll need to exploit opportunities to carpool or use a low emission vehicle (think electric with solar).&#xD;&#xA; - what will the building situation look like?  If you can't directly compare electric and heating bills, consider the natural lighting, the climate (a more extreme climate leads to increased HVAC loads), insulation and air leakiness of the house.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now more specific to your question, let's hold these factors constant and just consider how adding an additional person to a house can contribute to sustainability.  Every four years the EIA conducts a [residential energy consumer survey](http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption#summary).  Now here is some data I love and think would be very interesting to you  (there is a bunch of other great stuff in there for any data junkies):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are substantial energy savings from increasing the number of members per household. However *there are diminishing returns* to adding another member to the house.  So the first person would contribute 30% per capita energy savings, the second 20%, the third 10%.  This is important from a macro-perspective.  Let's say you have 30 people and developers are considering design occupancy.  The improvement from going from six 5-person units to five 6-person units is not as significant as moving from fifteen 2-person units to ten 3-person units.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From your perspective as an individual (or couple), there will be significant advantages to living in 5+ person house compared to a house for one or two people.  Let's say you are considering a two person house vs a six person house.  Moving into the two person house, you would be responsible for 50% of the 2-person house's primary energy (45 MBtu).  If you were the sixth person in a five person house, you would be responsible for 4MBtu margin of going from 5 person to six person house.  **A huge difference!**  These gains are mostly from shared energy sources, such as a refrigerator, shared lighting, shared air temperature etc.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Obviously energy consumption is very different outside US, but the principles should hold. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ipXsv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/blWi7.png" />

If you have a composter or a vermipost bin, those will work too.  Below is my own method though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend to aggressively sheet mulch.  While I am here in Indonesia I am known to prune the mango trees to get leaves to sheet mulch.  These allow me to compost a fair bit of stuff in place.The leaves are definitely a green and they take a few weeks to decompose.  The basic structure here is an alternating set of layers of &quot;greens&quot; and &quot;browns&quot; to help speed composting, but these are small and make use of surface area and ground contact rather than size and heat.  In this way I incorporate smallish amounts of more risky foods (like cooked veggies) underneath the mulch, between the mulch and the soil.  I find that if I do this, it decomposes fast and the sorts of animals attracted tend to be small decomposers like centipedes, ants, and earthworms.  The 4 inch layer of leaves act as a bit of an odor damper and help avoid some of the more noxious pests (like cockroaches).  Other approaches might include plastic composters, covered piles, vermipost, or the like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As always pest management is very local so what works for me may not work for you.

I'll try to address some more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Battery End-of-Life&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your question is obviously referring to **standard** car batteries, which are used to power the car's starter motor.  These are generally lead-acid batteries.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A true Electric Car (EV) may have a small battery just like this (e.g. to drive accesories), but this kind of battery is **not** what drives the car, and is not the big impact on the recycling/landfill issue.  An EV's traction motor will probably be a NiMH or Li-ion battery pack.  It's very large, and very expensive.  It also happens to be about 85% recyclable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My 2011 Nissan LEAF has a 24 KWh capacity Li-ion battery pack in it.  At this point, it's hard to tell exactly what the longevity will be, because it's a new product.  However, automakers do test these things before fielding new models (the results are obviously important when they decide what kind of warranties to offer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nissan projects the life of this battery pack to be 10 years.  What does that mean?  By their definition, at the end of 10 years of life, it will have a useful capacity that's 70-80% of its original capacity, depending on how you use it.  So, by no means is the battery *dead*.  But, they're estimating what a user would be willing to tolerate in terms of driving range reduction.  If your trips tend to be 20 miles or less, or you have recharge facilities at your typical destination (e.g. workplace charging), then you may continue to use your 10 year-old batteries.  But, 10 years seems like a reasonable longevity estimate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Currently, the bigger a battery is, the more likely you can recycle it, and even get paid to do so.  As I said, a Li-ion battery is largely recyclable, and with 70-80% capacity, even still usable for non-automotive energy storage applications.  It's **very** hard to believe that a battery pack that originally cost [several thousand dollars](http://green.autoblog.com/2010/05/15/nissan-leaf-profitable-by-year-three-battery-cost-closer-to-18/), that still has 70% capacity, and is 85% recyclable, wouldn't fetch a significant trade-in value.  This value will likely ensure that EV batteries are not simply thrown away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Energy Efficiency / Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As EnergyNumbers said, the overall energy efficiency of an EV depends highly on *where* the electricity came from.  **However, whether it's more environmentally friendly than standard gas internal combustion engines (ICE) does not.**  Even if all the car's electricity comes from coal, which is our dirtiest source of electricity, an EV is about 25% more energy efficient than a gas ICE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[From this Union of Concerned Scientists report](http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf), the average midsize gas ICE fuel economy is 26 mpg.  Based largely on the (midsize) Nissan LEAF, the EV well-to-wheels equivalent energy economy is 30 mpg&lt;sub&gt;ghg&lt;/sub&gt;.  So, that's already a 15% improvement for the 100% coal-powered EV.  However, a gas ICE's fuel economy is not rated *well-to-wheels*.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like electricity, gas requires energy to make.  Currently, [gas and petro-diesel average an *energy ratio* of about 0.8 to 0.9](http://www.usda.gov/oce/reports/energy/EnergyLifeCycleSoybeanBiodieseI6-11.pdf), which means that to produce a gallon of gas, you have to spend about .1 to .2 gallons to make it.  For Saudi oil, it takes relatively little energy to produce.  However, as that runs out, and we continue to get more gas/diesel from deepwater rigs, and tar sands oil, gas and diesel will become even more costly (and environmentally damaging) to produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, when you perform well-to-wheels accounting, an EV *starts* at about 25% better than an ICE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** a well-publicized [report has recently been released](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/advanced-vehicle-technologies/electric-cars/emissions-and-charging-costs-electric-cars.html), that found Toyota Prius to be more GHG friendly than Nissan LEAF in most US states (accounting for where each state gets power from).  However, it's important to note that the Prius has a lower drag coefficient than LEAF (0.28 vs 0.30), which will increase energy economy, but is unrelated to the cars' powertrains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know how environmentally-friendly *you* think EVs are, but yes, they are more environmentally friendly than standard gas engine cars, in almost every way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll try to post more here as I get time ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

You can't create energy from nothing, and no process is perfectly energy efficient.  In order to *build* an animal from food, first you have to grow, process, and transport the food.  The animal has to eat it and process the food into energy, which it does not do with perfect efficiency.

So, there's no one answer here.  But, a reasonable range, for example, might be that in order to produce a given unit of beef energy (e.g. a *calorie*), you have to put in 6 to [50 times that much energy](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) in the process.

I'll try to address some more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Battery End-of-Life&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your question is obviously referring to **standard** car batteries, which are used to power the car's starter motor.  These are generally lead-acid batteries.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A true Electric Vehicle (EV) may have a small battery just like this (e.g. to drive accesories), but this kind of battery is **not** what drives the car, and is not the big impact on the recycling/landfill issue.  An EV's traction motor will probably use a NiMH or Li-ion battery pack.  It's very large, and very expensive.  It also happens to be about 85% recyclable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My 2011 Nissan LEAF has a 24 KWh capacity Li-ion battery pack in it.  At this point, it's hard to tell exactly what the longevity will be, because it's a new product.  However, automakers do test these things before fielding new models (the results are obviously important when they decide what kind of warranties to offer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nissan projects the life of this battery pack to be 10 years.  What does that mean?  By their definition, at the end of 10 years of life, it will have a useful capacity that's 70-80% of its original capacity, depending on how you use it.  So, by no means is the battery *dead*.  But, they're estimating what a user would be willing to tolerate in terms of driving range reduction.  If your trips tend to be 20 miles or less, or you have recharge facilities at your typical destination (e.g. workplace charging), then you may continue to use your 10 year-old batteries.  But, 10 years seems like a reasonable longevity estimate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Currently, the bigger a battery is (all else equal), the more likely you can recycle it, and even get paid to do so.  As I said, a Li-ion battery is largely recyclable, and with 70-80% capacity, even still usable for non-automotive energy storage applications.  It's **very** hard to believe that a battery pack that originally cost [several thousand dollars](http://green.autoblog.com/2010/05/15/nissan-leaf-profitable-by-year-three-battery-cost-closer-to-18/), that still has 70% capacity, and is 85% recyclable, wouldn't fetch a significant trade-in value.  This value will likely ensure that EV batteries are not simply thrown away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Energy Efficiency / Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As EnergyNumbers said, the overall energy efficiency of an EV depends highly on *where* the electricity came from.  **However, whether it's more environmentally friendly than standard gas internal combustion engines (ICE) does not.**  Even if all the car's electricity comes from coal, which is our dirtiest source of electricity, an EV is about 25% more energy efficient than a gas ICE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[From this Union of Concerned Scientists report](http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf), the average midsize gas ICE fuel economy is 26 mpg.  Based largely on the (midsize) Nissan LEAF, the EV well-to-wheels equivalent energy economy is 30 mpg&lt;sub&gt;ghg&lt;/sub&gt;.  So, that's already a 15% improvement for the 100% coal-powered EV.  However, a gas ICE's fuel economy is not rated *well-to-wheels*.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like electricity, gas requires energy to make.  Currently, [gas and petro-diesel average an *energy ratio* of about 0.8 to 0.9](http://www.usda.gov/oce/reports/energy/EnergyLifeCycleSoybeanBiodieseI6-11.pdf), which means that to produce a gallon of gas, you have to spend about .1 to .2 gallons to make it.  For Saudi oil, it takes relatively little energy to produce.  However, as that runs out, and we continue to get more gas/diesel from deepwater rigs, and tar sands oil, gas and diesel will become even more costly (and environmentally damaging) to produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, when you perform well-to-wheels accounting, an EV *starts* at about 25% better than a gasoline ICE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** a well-publicized [report has recently been released](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/advanced-vehicle-technologies/electric-cars/emissions-and-charging-costs-electric-cars.html), that found Toyota Prius to be more GHG friendly than Nissan LEAF in most US states (accounting for where each state gets power from).  However, it's important to note that the Prius has a lower drag coefficient than LEAF (0.25 vs 0.28), which will increase energy economy, but is unrelated to the cars' powertrains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know how environmentally-friendly *you* think EVs are, but yes, they are more environmentally friendly than standard gas engine cars, in almost every way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll try to post more here as I get time ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

[Meat is hands-down the most inefficient, unsustainable way to feed a human being, as it stands today](http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/energy-required-to-produce-a-pound-of-food.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To really go back to first principles, consider the laws of thermodynamics.  You can't create energy from nothing, and no process is perfectly energy efficient.  In order to *build* an animal from food, first you have to grow, process, and transport the food.  The animal has to eat it and process the food into energy, which it does not do with perfect efficiency.  Then, the animal has to live for a while (weeks, months, or years, depending on the meat), during which time it has to move around, eat, poop, heat itself and make noise.  All these things take energy.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of performing this cycle, skip the animal altogether and just grow (non-animal) food that can be directly consumed by humans.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How inefficient it is to eat meat depends on the animal, what you feed it, and the processes used.  So, there's no one answer here.  But, a reasonable range, for example, might be that in order to produce a given unit of beef energy (e.g. a *calorie*), you have to put in 6 to [50 times that much energy](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) in the process.  That puts the effective energy efficiency of the process at between 2% and 16%.  That's terrible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, it gets worse.  The previous figures only discussed *energy* efficiency.  If you believe that climate change is a problem, you should understand that not all greenhouse gases are equally *potent*.  [Methane is 22x more *effective* at trapping heat in the atmosphere](http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html) than is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the animals we get our meat from produce a lot of methane, meaning that their contribution to global warming is even worse than suggested by looking at their energy efficiency alone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, don't eat meat (cow, pig, sheep, deer, etc.) in the first place.  Poultry (chicken, turkey) is a bit better.  Seafood is better still.  A vegetarian or vegan diet is most sustainable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##If You Do Eat Meat, Don't Compost It&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As had been said many times on this site, including in [Chris's answer](http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/174/486), sustainability choices should be prioritized to reduce use first, then reuse second, then recycle last.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why do you have **extra** meat at all?  If you have leftover meat, then buy a smaller cut.  Virtually everywhere I see meat sold allows you to buy pieces in an almost continuous array of sizes.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the developing world, [currently about 1/3 of food is lost](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/the-conundrum-of-food-waste/), mostly to disease or spoilage (lack of preservatives, but also refrigeration).  However, in the developed world, the loss is almost exactly the same (1/3), for different reasons.  One reason is people buying and preparing more food than they need, and just throwing the rest out (or composting it).  If you need to eat 2000 calories per day, then prepare 2000 calories.  Don't prepare 2500, and then compost the unused portion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you find yourself in the scenario where you can't find a way to stop eating meat, you try to buy the right-sized portion, but you still have leftovers, then save the edible meat for tomorrow.  Chop it up to make a lunch sandwich.  If you still have fat and gristle left, those things probably won't break down quickly in your compost bin, and can create health/rodent concerns outlined in other answers.  Just bury the fat in a hole you dig.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Aside:* in response to the plethora of responses everywhere online about people saying &quot;I compost meat and rarely see rats&quot;, I respond: &quot;Rats tend to come out when you're not there.  Trust me, they find the meat, unless your bin is under tight lockdown.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Asking a sustainability question about putting meat in a compost pile really is like asking one about the proper tire inflation pressure for a Humvee.  True, you can save some gas by keeping tires inflated properly, but if you have a Humvee at all, you've already gone awry.  I don't pose this comparison, simply as a rhetorical tactic.  The direct contribution of agriculture to global warming is roughly equivalent to that of transportation ([about 10-15%](http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/3213/Climate_change_and_agriculture.html)).  If you add in secondary effects from land-use change, it's even worse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deciding not to eat farmed meat at all is one of those currently uncomfortable sustainability solutions, along with having fewer babies, and not keeping pets.  People don't want to consider it, but the impact of the choice is large, and completely within your control, right now." />

I have a modern fuel-injected machine, so the chain is the only source of storm-water pollution I can think of. I try to use as little oil as necessary to keep drivetrain lubricated and efficient, and reduce fling. Yet, “as little” is not “none at all”, so I am looking for some alternatives, vegetable or synthetic, that would be economical, minimizes pollution of the soil and water, but at the same time would posses necessary qualities of lubricity, viscosity, and not very sticky to reduce attraction of dirt. If the same type of oil could be used in the marine outboard motor’s gear case, all the better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both applications, my needs are by no means high-performance — 12 kW (16 rwhp) motorcycle, and a range of outboards of up to 20 hp.

The amount of oil from your chain is small even compared to the amount of oil that comes out of your exhaust, which in turn is small compared to the unburned hydrocarbons from the gasoline, which in tuern is small compared to what everyone in their SUV's are releasing.  You are already a good citizen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But that's not what you asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take a look at some of the products at bicycle shops.  One product I like is a graphite powder in mineral spirt solvent &amp; oil.  The spirits evaporate, leaving the graphite with enough of a film of oil to keep the graphite from running away.  There is s simlar product that uses teflon.  A friend who is an ardent cyclist claims that for these to work well, you have to remove ALL the oil from the chain.  This usually means two washes with solvent, then a wash in acetone to remove the oil film left by the solvent.  But talk to the guys in the bicycle shop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Caveat:  The forces between chain and tooth are a LOT smaller on a bicycle than on a motor bike.  If this doesn't work you may need two new sprokets and a chain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My estimate is that the graphite would work better. The key for it is keeping it attached to the chain.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an outboard motor, the key is keeping the seals intact.  Also:  Many outboard motors discharge their exhaust under water.  This is NOT friendly.  Run your motor in a barrel of water for 20 minutes, let the water set overnight, and look at the reflection in the morning.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Almost all pollutants are tolerable sufficiently diluted.  Using a tiny put-put going through a swamp that sees a dozen boats a year is unlikely to be an issue.  Take  close look at the shore line, however at any marina." />

The mango leaves are usually green when put in, the papaya leaves may be harvested when the show that they are about to fade.

And since the bottom of the kettle is not vented, there's not much opportunity for convection to pull heat away from the heating element. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The stove, on the other hand, relies on the weight of the pan to make contact with the element, and the spiral element may not be completely level, so some parts of the element are in better contact than others. Since the bottom of the element is exposed, it is free to radiate some of the heat down into the stove drip pan. Also, there seem to be some convection air currents carrying heat away, since if I hold my hand a few inches over the pan while heating water, it becomes uncomfortably warm in a short period of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I agree that there is some  heat lost in heating up both the kettle and the the pan, the specific heat of water is about 8 times greater than stainless steel, so the energy wasted in heating up the 24 ounce kettle is around the same energy needed to heat up 3 ounces of water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, it all depends on what type of appliances you're using. I have a stove with traditional spiral elements, if I had an inductive cooktop, it's likely that it would be more efficient than the electric kettle since more of the stove's energy would be going into the cooking pan. A glass cooktop with heating elements or infrared elements might also change the equation. As would a gas stove." />

I throw very little away if I am managing the food.  This can keep waste down well below what people consider waste.  It takes some trial and error to get right (no onion skins can't go in the stock bag and neither can squash skins), and those can be costly in terms of throwing stuff away but once you get it, this leads to hyper-efficiency in terms of food (throwing away less than people would if they ate everything they cooked).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.  Focus on fewer more re-usable ingredients as your staples.  These include things like onions, cabbage, and other relatively long-keeping vegetables (onions don't need to be refridgerated, cabbage can last a long time in the fridge).  Buy many other things when you need them (like meat).  This gives you fresher food and better awareness of what is in the fridge.  My own primary staples tend to be beans (various kinds, dry), cabbage, onions, garlic and garlic.  I try to keep all of these around all the time.  I tend to buy tomatoes when I want to use them.  Keep in mind if I am by myself I can go through cabbage between one head in a couple of days to one head in two weeks, so having two heads of cabbage in my fridge is usually a good thing since it keeps well.  Other things like tomatoes, other veggies, meat (when I don't have it in my freezer from local farm purchases), etc. I buy for the meal I want to cook.  This means shopping every few days.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2.  Rely on the freezer more for left overs.  This lets you cook larger batches and re-heat when you want to.  I frequently cook 10 to 15 meals worth of food at once.  Some of it goes in the freezer.  Sometimes I eat it for a week, but if you rely on your freezer you don't have to eat it for a week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.  Keep a stock bag in the freezer.  In it goes onion and vegetable ends (but not lots of skins), bones, cooked meat leftovers I don't get to within a week, etc.  When it gets full, I put it in a pot with water and boil to make a broth.  The remains go into the compost, and the stock goes into the freezer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I find is that if more of my fridge is used for staples, and less is used for short term ingredients, I throw a lot less away.  I also eat a lot more cabbage and that can't be bad.....  I also cook less frequently and rely on leftovers more.  The freezer can be used to enforce variety." />

I'd guess it's near zero, since it's a cargo ship which needs some basic facilities for the crew anyway, so one person doesn't mean a difference. The twelve passengers limit for cruisers without a doctor means freighter travel isn't likely to be mass used, but for an individual travel it seems more sustainable than anything else (whether transport of anything on such distances is sustainable is another question)." />

Otherwise, windows are more fuel efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Episode 38&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; PARTLY CONFIRMED&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The fundamental flaw in the MythBusters’ test was that the point where the drag becomes powerful enough to inhibit a car’s performance with windows down was inside their 45 – 55mph margin at 50mph. Going less than 50mph it is more efficient to leave your windows down, but going greater than 50mph it is more efficient to use your A/C.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sadly unless you have the same vehicle, are driving in the same conditions and have the same comfort requiremennts, this tells you little about your own situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next time you fill up, decide on a strategy and stick to it until your next fill up, then calculate your overall fuel efficiency. Then try a different strategy and see if the efficiency changes. From a series of such tests you can build up a body of empirical evidence about how your own vehicle, preferences and environment interact, and thus find out what is most sustainable for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/736/164&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/5661/2772&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://mythbustersresults.com/episode22&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://mythbustersresults.com/episode38" />

And a hybrid never makes sense--it offers the worst of both worlds (all the pollution, manufacturing, and disposal footprint of internal combustion *and* electric).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All things considered, the fuel consumption of any vehicle is minor compared to the manufacturing, disposal, and maintenance footprints.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A used vehicle has the lowest manufacturing footprint, sometimes at the cost of greater maintenance footprint.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have read (disputed) reports that the environmental footprint of a Prius is the same as that of a Hummer after 100,000 miles. True or not, it helps one think about putting fuel consumption into perspective of the larger picture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Full disclosure: I have owned 6 diesel vehicles. I currently own an '86 TurboDiesel Jetta, and an '03 TDI Jetta. I have never owned a hybrid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without any specifics (because I don't know them):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A hybrid vehicle reduces emissions (although in the U.S., the most efficient hybrid is barely more efficient than the most efficient diesel vehicles, in Europe, there are even more efficient diesel vehicles).  It increases manufacturing and disposal footprint.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Environmental factors which are roughly the same for both a used biodiesel and new hybrid vehicle:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Engine coolant&#xD;&#xA;* Motor oil&#xD;&#xA;* Repairs for: Suspension, engine, windshield, etc&#xD;&#xA;* Disposal footprint for any vehicle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Factors which are greater for a new hybrid:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Manufacturing footprint of a new vehicle&#xD;&#xA;* Additional manufacturing footprint for batteries, electric motor, etc&#xD;&#xA;* Additional disposal footprint for batteries&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Factors which are greater for a used biodiesel vehicle:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* (Possibly&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) more fuel consumption, greater emissions&#xD;&#xA;* Possibly greater fuel manufacturing cost&#xD;&#xA;* Greater repair costs/footprint (compared to any new vehicle)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;My '03 TDI Jetta gets better fuel economy than all but the newest and smallest hybrids (and it's a lot more fun to drive).  All biodiesel is not created equal. If you have a source of biodiesel recycled from used oil, the fuel refinement cost is practically nothing. If you are buying commercial biodiesel in the U.S., it is almost certainly made from soym and onventional soy farming is not sustainable.  Although, the [most recent numbers from the USDA](http://www.usda.gov/oce/reports/energy/EnergyLifeCycleSoybeanBiodieseI6-11.pdf) suggest that soy biodiesel is more efficient than before (thanks @Nate). Although the USDA has a clear bias (an interest in promoting aggriculture), I have no specific reason to think their numbers are wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My suggestion, in order of least environmental impact (assuming you are using the most fuel-efficient vehicle in each class, that will suit your needs):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A bicycle&#xD;&#xA;* A used all-electric vehicle&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;* A used diesel vehicle, with recycled biodiesel or straight veg oil (SVO/WVO)&#xD;&#xA;* A used diesel vehicle, with standard diesel or soy biodiesel&#xD;&#xA;* A used gasoline vehicle&#xD;&#xA;* A new all-electric vehicle&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;* A new diesel vehicle&#xD;&#xA;* A new gasoline vehicle&#xD;&#xA;* A used hybrid&lt;sup&gt;*\*\*&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;* A new hybrid&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;I don't actually know if an all-electric vehicle is better than internal combustion, but I suspect it is, because it reduces the mass of the vehicle, and many peripheral fluids (engine coolant, motor oil, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;*\*\*&lt;/sup&gt;It's hard to rank hybrids accurately.  Some biased sources claim they are devilspawn. Other sources, biased in the other direction, claim they're heaven-sent. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  So take this absolute raking with a grain of salt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that even without biodiesel, a diesel vehicle is more sustainable than a gasoline vehicle.  All other things equal, diesel gets roughly 33% better fuel economy than gasoline per fuel volume.  Diesel refining is also, arguably, less harmful to the environment than gasoline.  And lastly, a diesel engine is mechanically simpler than a gasoline engine, and thus will last longer (500k miles is common).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest looking for a good quality used diesel vehicle.  A 2000-2003 Jetta TDI is the ideal right now, easily over 50mpg highway.  But even the newer Jettas still get excellent fuel economy, and the older ones can, too. My '86 gets about 40mpg.  My '03 about 52mpg." />

Assuming this is no problem, my best bet would be that a mix of Eisenia Fetida and Eisenia Hortensis has the highest throughput rate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Long answer**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most research on vermicomposting focuses on reproduction and grow rates of different worms species. It is assumed that higher reproduction rates means more juvenile worms which in turn means a higher processing rate. I'm not entirely sure if this assumption is true but since we have nothing else to go on I'll stick with reproduction and grow rates for my answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mixing worm species can be done just fine as long as you can keep the conditions in your bin suited for all species involved. Chances are however that the conditions will be more favorable for one particular type of worm and that this worm will flourish and the population of the other worms will decline, so not all combinations of worm species will result in an effective mix.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most research on vermicomposting worms favor Eisenia Fetida (a.k.a red worm) for a number of reasons. Fetida worms have fast reproduction and grow rates, they tolerate and can survive under a wide range of circumstances, and they don't mind disturbances of their enviroment (at least not so much as other worm species like the Eudrilus Eugeniae). This is probably the reason that the Fetida worm is the most popular one for vermicomposting. A bin with only Fetida worms certainly is a good choice to get a good throughput rate under different circumstances. The only problem with Fetida worms is that they tend to stay close to the surface. They don't eat food that is buried deep into a bin. That's why I think you might be able to get a slightly higher throughput rate if you add Eisenia Hortensis (a.k.a. Dendobaena Veneta or European nightcrawler) worms. Hortensis worms like it a bit more wet and colder than Fetida worms, but both species will do ok at . Additionally, Hortensis worms like to spread out all over the bin so if you add food both at the top and deeper into the bin you'll get a larger surface of active worms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there has been some discussion about Hortensis worms. Research done in the late 80s and early 90s showed that the Hortensis had a rather low reproduction and grow rate, but in the late 90s this has been questioned by a number of worm farmers. Several people have reported that they found that the Hortensis worm can grow and reproduce just as fast as the Fetida and claim the different results can be explained by the difference in bin conditions or in the food supplied to the worms. I'm not sure if the high reproduction rate of the Hortensis has already been proven scientifically but the fact is that the Hortensis worm has gained quite a bit of popularity in the last 10 years. If the Hortensis worm indeed has a similar reproduction and grow rate then it may outperform the Fetida worm when it comes to throughput rates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like I said in my quick answer, ultimately it will depend on the circumstances in your bin(s) and your abilities to keep those circumstances ideal for one or more types of worms. If you have a rather wet bin, it might be best just to use only Hortensis worms. If you have a lot of temperature changes the Fetida worm may be more better. If your bin is kept at a constant temperature of around 25 Celsius (77 F) a bin with only Eudrilus Eugeniae might be the better choice. The best way to found out what works for you is to experiment yourself." />

If you run your dishwasher half full, that's going to be bad for energy and water use.  Similarly, if you hand wash, with the hot water running the whole time, that's bad.  So, either technique requires tuning the way you use it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, dishwashers have some inherent advantages, in that they're closed units.  Being closed units allows them to build up heat and humidity.  That helps the washing process.  It also means that water sprayed on dishes in the upper rack can then filter down, and rinse dishes in the lower rack.  The same goes for water that's sprayed horizontally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rather than try to reproduce such an analysis myself, I'll point to an [article on treehugger.com](http://www.treehugger.com/kitchen-design/built-in-dishwashers-vs-hand-washing-which-is-greener.html).  An important excerpt:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; These numbers indicate that it's possible to be more efficient when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hand-washing, but it's pretty tough. Can you successfully wash and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rinse a soiled dinner plate in just over a cup of water? If you can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; keep the water use low, equal to an efficient machine, you'll require&#xD;&#xA;&gt; less energy, but doing an entire load of dishes in 4 gallons of water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is roughly equivalent to doing them all in the same amount of water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you use in 96 seconds of showering (using a showerhead that emits 2.5&#xD;&#xA;&gt; gallons per minute).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; So, as long as you don't often run your dishwasher when it's only half&#xD;&#xA;&gt; full of dirty dishes, or unless you are very miserly with your water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; use (or have an old, inefficient dishwasher), the automatic dishwasher&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is likely to be more efficient. That is to say, it's possible to use&#xD;&#xA;&gt; less water and energy by hand washing your dishes, but it's not easy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll also address another point in the other answer.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you automate things, you substitute electricity for manual energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Manual energy&quot; doesn't come from nowhere.   It comes from the food we eat.  Powering a human being involves converting sun, water, and soil into food, processing the food, then letting the human convert it into usable energy.  **The human body, combined with the agricultural inputs**, do not represent an *efficient* machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd also offer the somewhat economic argument regarding [opportunity cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).  The time you'd spend handwashing dishes might better be spent on something else.  If you're interested in sustainability (yeah!), then consider what other sustainable projects you could work on with the X hours a month you'd spend handwashing dishes.

The light gets absorbed into objects and stays there. To keep the light buzzing through your room to make it feel bright, you need to make sure that as much in your room as possible reflects light. Mirrors reflect almost 100% of the light, i.e. more mirrors means less light absorption means a brighter room. Light colours (white) reflect more light than dark colours (brown/black). If you change your interior design, you will have a brighter room and may not need to add more light. (If you add mirrors to your room, it would be most efficient to place them where the light enters the room.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Often, countries with long winters (e.g. Norway, see below) have bright interior designs, because in the winter period one has to keep as much light as possible from being absorbed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Countries with mild winters and strong sun during the day (e.g. Spain, picture below) tend to have darker designs, presumably to allow the eyes to rest at least inside the house.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Norwegian house](http://maxcdn.fooyoh.com/files/attach/images/627/587/592/vivendelstien-house-in-norway-2.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Spanish office](http://theluxhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Elegant-and-luxurious-office-interior-design-ideas-1-533x354.jpg)" />

In other words, I think it's clear that with **no** education, humans would still be stuck in primitive societies, which **were** sustainable, and involved small per capita resource usage.  As education increases, you do get an increase in resource consumption, with a standard-of-living increase.  However, I believe that in the future, we can achieve lower levels of resource consumption again, with further **increases** in education.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    More time living alone means more energy consumption.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Staying in school doesn't just mean *&quot;living alone&quot;*.  It probably also means living modestly, in a small apartment.  And it often does mean living with roommates.  The people at both the universities I went to (in the US) all lived with small energy and spatial footprints, relative to working adults in the surrounding society.  So, I'd say this issue favors staying in school, as more sustainable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[A link on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; footprint vs. age that reflects this issue](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/if-you-act-your-age-whats-your-carbon-footprint/), although school vs. work at the same age is not teased apart.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    Fewer children may have both positive and negative effects. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While, technically this is true (there are positive **and** negative effects), I strongly disagree with the implied equivalency.  Human beings consume lots of resources.  Lots.  In those countries where higher education is a realistic option (as posed in your question), humans consume even more resources.  More humans fundamentally means more resource consumption.  Not to mention the basic math that birth rates above the [replacement rate](http://www.wikigender.org/index.php/Replacement_rate) are *inherently* unsustainable, as long as we're bound to this one planet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    Less career time means less overall energy available for manual production.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exactly.  As I alluded to earlier, students do have lower environmental footprints than an average working adult.  The amount of work output by today's current population vastly exceeds that required to fulfill basic human needs (as evidenced by many of us working in jobs that are not fundamentally **necessary**).  We need people to be working at jobs **less** than they do now (in the developed world), and producing less.  I'm not advocating education simply on the grounds that it takes time away from production, but I do believe that's a beneficial side effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and the labor is automated via cheap energy sources like fossil fuels. This leads to less flexibility regarding reducing energy usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Labor will be automated regardless, and less educated workers could actually provide more incentive to automate.  I've seen a number of your posts on the site that suggest to me that you think *automation* fundamentally increases energy usage.  While that could be its own separate discussion, I'll merely assert here that I find that to be false (and my apologies if that's not actually your belief).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;    Less time and flexibility to make informed choices regarding sustainability because of additional burdens like student loans requiring additional efforts to make ends meet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, you **can't** make informed choices without education.  Education underlies all decision-making.  If there's any obstacle to sustainability today in the US (where I live), it's **ignorance** of the basic science that supports consensus thinking on climate change.  While there are educated skeptics who simply don't trust climate science, want more data, or believe the solution is elsewhere (not sustainability, but something like *geoengineering*), the majority here are skeptical because of a lack of basic understanding of the science.  I believe a subject like this, while possible to treat at the high school level, is probably better expanded on at universities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, at least in the US, it's not true that taking out student loans requires working more to make ends meet.  It's precisely the opposite.  [Higher levels of education reap higher lifetime earnings](http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf) by an amount that easily pays for the cost of the extra education (plus interest).  Granted, that equation is going to be different in every country, as tuition rates vary, as do student loan interest rates.  But, based simply on the example of the world's largest developed economy, you do **not** wind up having to work more simply because you paid for more education.  You may *choose* to work more, because you have a more enjoyable career, or have suffered less *wear-and-tear* from a white collar career.  But, that's a separate point.&#xD;&#xA;" />

For some jobs it just doesn't work, of course. For example, a commercial cleaner is never going to &quot;work from home&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have largely here just referred to &quot;cost&quot; rather than energy cost except in a few specific cases. While energy cost percentage of a given item or service varies with circumstance, in an open market where other factors have not been purposefully brought to bear (directed taxes and duties, marketing 'spin', cartels,...) , energy cost is a significant and *very roughly* constant proportion of total cost.   &#xD;&#xA;[eg Oil costs nothing when it is in the ground. The major part of its market cost is the cost of exploration, field development, extraction and transportation. These in turn can be broken down into components where energy cost ends up playing a major part. And ultimately you get back to the cost of oil as the main factor in the cost of oil :-).   &#xD;&#xA;The price of diamonds and the cost of diamonds are essentially unrelated.   &#xD;&#xA;The cost of Nike products includes a large &quot;Just do it&quot; factor.]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Starting with just &quot;cost&quot; is often an OK enough proxy for energy costs while a first impression is gained of what other factors are involved. This can then be refined as required. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It depends on distance involved.  &#xD;&#xA;Take the two  extremes and you get different answers, indicating that there is a crossover point at some stage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At one extreme, if your home was  &quot;just around the corner&quot; from work premises then duplication of facilities would be liable to be inefficient. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At the other extreme, once work-location and company physical location are separated, you can communicate across a city or across the world just as easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - But as distance rises the cost and time for sending physical objects varies, so the importance and frequency of doing this affects the crossover point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Various factors discussed below modify where this crossover point will be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How much distance matters depends on job type and how well you can operate at a large distance. Distance can increase efficiency of telecommuting because of the cost savings of you not having to travel, and increase the cost on the occasions when you do have to travel. Within a city or regional area factors include type of job, traffic densities, distance between the locations, quality of transport infrastructure and more. It is reasonably common in Asia for people to travel for 2 or more hours per day in each direction, but many take far less than this. I do not know the expectations in say the US or Europe but trip times of half an hour to one hour + would be usual here (Auckland, New Zealand's largest city) and two hours would be unusual but not unknown. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have to send papers or equipment or samples or work output then distance and time taken rise in 'steps'. Sending materiel across a city takes hours to a day by courier. Sending by post often next day or two days. Shorter times cost more as distance rises (&quot;1 hour&quot; couriers etc). In most 'developed countries' across a country sending by courier takes maybe a day or two, possibly three (depends on local factors). Sending small items (up to 10 or 20 kg say*) or papers across the world takes 3 days if you are happy to pay between an hour and a day of equivalent salary (depending on what your local earning levels are) or weeks to many weeks at lower but non-trivial cost. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your job depends only on &quot;communications&quot; and you seldom or never need to send physical objects then it's more efficient to tele-commute in extreme cases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To complicate the mix throw in worker trustability, ability to supervise and ability to obtain assistance or guidance when needed. Ability tos share with others you are working with or for can be critically important or of minimal relevance depending on the job involved. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So  while, as noted above , somewhere there will be a &quot;crossover point&quot; it is so influenced by the above factors and many more that a simple (or even quite complex) formula is only going to be a starting point, and a study is likely to be required in each case where factors differ markedly from others already in operation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;____________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two extreme examples:  &#xD;&#xA;In a recent TV program here the owner managers of a UK based company, who live in New Zealand (12,000 miles and about two days away) were discussing their customer helpline operation. The job requires &quot;only&quot; a 'telephone' connection and computer access.   &#xD;&#xA;Up until 7:59 pm each day, UK time,  this is operated by UK company staff. At 8pm you will be answered by a company employee in New Zealand. The calls are not outsourced. The people who talk to customers are product experts and company employees. They have access to the same company computer databases and resources. Interestingly, while they are 12,000 miles away from the customers, in this instance they still work in an office in NZ, and not at their homes. On the one hand the company has its NZ employees &quot;tele-commute&quot; 12,000 miles, but have not taken the final step of allowing them to take the final step, even though technology would allow it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am close to but not quite at the extreme end. I sit at my desk or workshop in New Zealand. As required I work almost simultaneously at various places elsewhere on earth - at present in USA, Canada, Serbia and China as required. Nobody that I work for or with is in NZ with me. Commuting is fun enough, when I occasionally get to do it, but there is no daily &quot;travelling to work&quot;. When you take the energy costs of travel plus a proportion of accommodation &amp; other costs involved (to allow for their energy costs) it adds up to what would be a modest but significant transportation budget if I travelled within my own city. But the annual travel hours are significantly lower, even allowing for the duration of international travel. Occasionally samples and prototypes do have to be sent across the world (usually NZ-China) costing time and money. But, quite apart from the fact that it would be impossible to be in all the places I need to be if I did not work &quot;remotely&quot;, the cost of 'working from home' is lower than it would be for me to work on the far side of my own city. I think it probable that by any metric that you choose, it is lower cost for me to &quot;telecommute&quot; than not to. I have not discussed the  cost of work premises or equipment or the affects of tax concessions for 'home offices' etc as they further complicate what is essentially a very broad overview. . &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_____________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Many major international courier companies offer &quot;Jumbo&quot; boxes with 10 kg or 20 kg maximum weight and &quot;all you can fit in&quot; volume constraint. These are often superbly cost effective if you need to send more than about 50% of their weight in the volume provided. &#xD;&#xA;" />

The other 400 W are dissipated as heat, mostly in the magnetron tube. Additional power is used to operate the lamps, AC power transformer, magnetron cooling fan, food turntable motor and the control circuits. Such wasted heat, along with heat from the product being microwaved, is exhausted as warm air through cooling vents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, it seems that not all the microwave power is converted directly to the heat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that, for the good-quality kettle, power efficiency is close to 100%, boiling one cup of tea in a microwave oven requires the same energy as boiling 1.5 (or more) cups of tea in a kettle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you consume the tea in significant quantities, the most efficient way would be to use an [electric water boiler][2]. Heat losses in these are close to zero, so it is okay to boil more water than you need at the moment; and power efficiency is close to 100% (as nearly all the electricity is converted directly to the heat).

Boil the kettle, measure the wattage, and time how long it takes to boil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Microwave and frog mug][1]&#xD;&#xA;![Electric kettle and dog mug][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Results&#xD;&#xA;=======&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Frog Mug, in the microwave:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - My thermometer only goes up to 50 degrees C, so I very briefly took out the Frog Mug at 30s and 50s to measure the temperature, which was 32 degrees and 40 degrees respectively. I put it on for a further 2 minutes after that, for a total of 2 minutes 50 seconds.&#xD;&#xA; - Though it was a little hard to see through the mesh in the microwave while it was running, the water just started to appear to boil after 2m50s.&#xD;&#xA; - The microwave used 1315 watts of power throughout the test, thus using a total of 223550 Watt-seconds of power. If I did my calculations correctly, this is 0.062kWh (which costs a bit under 2 cents here).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Dog Mug, from the kettle:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - It took 1m 28s for the water to start to boil in the kettle, however it didn't automatically shut itself off until 1m52s. &#xD;&#xA; - The kettle used 990 Watts of power, which gives a total power usage of 110880 Watt-seconds, or 0.031kWh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thoughts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The microwave would also have been heating the Frog Mug as it heated the water, so this gives a hotter cup of tea than the kettle, unless some hot water from the kettle is swirled around the mug and discarded before pouring from the kettle. Water in a lighter (or less thermally conductive) mug would boil quicker.&#xD;&#xA; - The heat lost by my measuring of the temperature of the water in the Frog Mug would probably have been fairly minimal, but still non-zero.&#xD;&#xA; - My Frog Mug weighs 366g, though I have a mug of similar size that only weighs 252g.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;==========&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The water heated by the electric kettle used only about half the energy of the water heated in the microwave, despite a greater quantity of water being heated.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I could have saved a further 23760 Watt-seconds, or 0.007kWh of power if I manually switched off the kettle when it first started boiling.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lu0TY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/n2sbM.jpg" />

It could mean &quot;resources will never run out&quot;. If no other factors apply and sustainability is the only meaning of life, no children, collective suicide and controlled extinction of human race seems to be the best solution. This is clearly not what we really want (not only because nuclear warfare and other ways we would probably do to assure controlled extinction are much less sustainable than status quo). &gt;=)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's other definition of sustainability: sustainable society can exist for very long time (even for the rest of humankind's existence) without destroying its environment and running out of all its resources (some may run out if they are completely replaced by other - but it takes time, so they mustn't be depleted very quickly). This is easier with less people, but discipline is much more important than numbers. Many people really trying to live sustainably produce less waste than few who don't care.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also the social aspect: slightly more than two children are ideal to sustain the society forever. Assuming most children will grow up and have their families (which is often not the case), much more children will lead to overpopulation, while less children will lead to aging of the population, high percentage of old and frail and decreased stability of the society. This doesn't mean that every family should have exactly 2.1 kid, but that it's good to move the average closer to this value. In most rich countries, we have a dilemma between having no/few children and improve the average planetwise (and make the country's society demographically less sustainable), or having many children and improve the average countrywise (but adding to global overpopulation). So it's up to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While we can argue a lot whether it's better to have many or few children, we would certainly all agree that it's important how you raise your kids. Few families can really teach their children to resist the ads and other influences forcing them to buy a lot of things and not to care about sustainability very much. My personal opinion is that ten children with sustainable habits and strong belief that loving family or nice countryside are more important than things and money are much more sustainable than one kid who think that hapiness is a function of money spent on products advertised on TV.  &#xD;&#xA;To conclude, I'd say that the best is as much children as you can raise well." />

Understand your demand profile.&#xD;&#xA;First you need to know the profile of your electricity use.  Ideally hour-by-hour for a whole year; but at least an understanding of what's likely to be the two underlying cycles:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;1. annual variations - how the load varies by month in a typical year.&#xD;&#xA;2. daily variations - how the load varies by hour in a typical day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the most effective things you can do, is to max out the efficiency of the equipment you want to power: so LED lighting that's over 100 lumens per watt, that sort of thing. That minimises both the generation capacity, and any storage capacity, you might need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 2. Understand the potential supply profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### 2a. Solar&#xD;&#xA;The nature of the solar resource, for photovoltaics, will be influenced by local shading patterns: the exact geometric configuration of buildings; and by the climate of the region you are in. If you can find a big-enough surface area that you can mount PV panels that would slope towards the equator, and almost never be shaded, that removes the local shading from the calculation, and that makes thing a lot simpler.  To get typical PV yield for your region, and to find out the best slope, then use a tool such as [PVGIS][1] or [PVWatts][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### 2b. wind&#xD;&#xA;The wind profile is much much more susceptible to local geometry than solar is.  But you should be able to get a decent broadbrush indication from your national meteorological service, or one of the various global wind-resource maps, to get a first estimate.  You can pretty much ignore most roof-mounted turbines: they've such a low yield that many won't generate equivalent energy to that used to make them. Pole-mounted turbines are a better bet, but if you're in an urban area, then it's fairly unlikely that wind will be a contributor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##3. Understand correlations between supply and demand&#xD;&#xA;Some demands are positively correlated with wind or solar; some are negatively correlated. It's important to understand those correlations, otherwise you risk generating power at all the wrong times, and not at the right times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, lighting may be predominantly a night-time demand, so it would be strongly negatively correlated with solar, and that's a bad thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To take some counter examples: solar for air-conditioning would be a good match, because air-conditioning demand is higher when it's very sunny. Wind in the UK is higher in winter than summer, so a demand that is higher in winter than summer would be a positive correlation and a good match: for example, heating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##4. Storage&#xD;&#xA;Generally, when many people think about renewables, they usually assume local storage is essential. And in most circumstances, they're wrong. The exception is when the site in question is not grid-connected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In such a case, then you'll have two choices: storage, or load disconnection. Storage is usually expensive, so make sure that you know the value of load disconnection, to price the storage correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There will then be a trade-off between the amount of storage you need, and the over-supply of generation capacity that you get.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/pvwatts/" />

Measure 252g of cold tap water into Frog Mug using electronic kitchen scales, being the amount I'd use to make a cup of tea. Temperature according to my thermometer is 18 degrees C.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Plug microwave in through power meter.&#xD;&#xA; 3. See how long the water in the Frog Mug takes to boil in the microwave, and measure wattage used.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Measure 252g of cold tap water into Dog Mug using electronic kitchen scales, being the amount I'd use to make a cup of tea. Temperature according to my thermometer is 18 degrees C. Add a little extra because otherwise I end up with lime scale from the kettle in my tea. Though I picked this amount roughly, this worked out to be 121g giving 373g altogether. I could've used a little less.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Pour the 373g of water into the electric kettle, and plug it in through the power meter.&#xD;&#xA; 6. Boil the kettle, measure the wattage, and time how long it takes to boil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Microwave and frog mug][1]&#xD;&#xA;![Electric kettle and dog mug][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Results&#xD;&#xA;-------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Frog Mug, in the microwave:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - My thermometer only goes up to 50 degrees C, so I very briefly took out the Frog Mug at 30s and 50s to measure the temperature, which was 32 degrees and 40 degrees respectively. I put it on for a further 2 minutes after that, for a total of 2 minutes 50 seconds.&#xD;&#xA; - Though it was a little hard to see through the mesh in the microwave while it was running, the water just started to appear to boil after 2m50s.&#xD;&#xA; - The microwave used 1315 watts of power throughout the test, thus using a total of 223550 Watt-seconds of power. If I did my calculations correctly, this is 0.062kWh (which costs a bit under 2 cents here).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Dog Mug, from the kettle:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - It took 1m 28s for the water to start to boil in the kettle, however it didn't automatically shut itself off until 1m52s. &#xD;&#xA; - The kettle used 990 Watts of power, which gives a total power usage of 110880 Watt-seconds, or 0.031kWh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thoughts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The microwave would also have been heating the Frog Mug as it heated the water, so this gives a hotter cup of tea than the kettle, unless some hot water from the kettle is swirled around the mug and discarded before pouring from the kettle. Water in a lighter (or less thermally conductive) mug would boil quicker.&#xD;&#xA; - The heat lost by my measuring of the temperature of the water in the Frog Mug would probably have been fairly minimal, but still non-zero.&#xD;&#xA; - My Frog Mug weighs 366g, though I have a mug of similar size that only weighs 252g.&#xD;&#xA; - Also bear in mind that boiling water in the microwave can [sometimes be dangerous][3].&#xD;&#xA; - The microwave (a Sharp Carousel) was purchased in approx 2004; I don't know if more recent models are any more efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The water heated by the electric kettle used only about half the energy of the water heated in the microwave, despite a greater amount of water being heated.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I could have saved a further 23760 Watt-seconds (21% of the total used), or 0.007kWh of power if I manually switched off the kettle when it first started boiling.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lu0TY.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/n2sbM.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/303/can-microwaved-water-explode/306#306" />

Insects are less likely to infest healthy and well-nourished plants.&#xD;&#xA; - Pull weeds around your plants as well. Insects such as aphids and   &#xD;&#xA;   stinkbugs feed on weeds; if they surround your plants, they're likely to attack them as well.&#xD;&#xA; - Plant herbs and flowers around your plants. Basil helps ward off whiteflies, which are harmful to tomatoes, and oregano can help protect tomato and cucumber plants. Carrots and sunflowers help deter pests from your tomato plants. Nasturtiums and marigolds help protect both tomato and cucumber plants.&#xD;&#xA; - Add natural predators. Soldier beetles, tachinid flies and braconid wasps feed on striped cucumber beetles, which can help protect your cucumber plants. Parasitic wasps will   help eliminate leafminers and stink bugs from your tomato plants.  Bigeyed bugs and minute pirate bugs attack tomato fruitworms that can destroy the fruit and stems of your tomato plants. Attract insect predators by growing plants that feature small flowers, such as daisies, dill and coneflower. These plants will encourage predators of insects and beneficial insects including ladybugs, nematodes, bats and birds.&#xD;&#xA; - Cover your organic vegetables-Spunbound Polyester Rowcover keeps out pests but allows light, air &amp; water to get through.&#xD;&#xA; - Spray neem oil-Oils &amp; seeds from the neem tree have been used in&#xD;&#xA;   India for centuries. It's a great, low-toxicity insecticide &amp;&#xD;&#xA;   fungicide.&#xD;&#xA; - Weed your garden well and regularly to minimize hiding places for&#xD;&#xA;   insect pests and to prevent the weeds from competing with your&#xD;&#xA;   vegetables for water and nutrients.  Spray vinegar-Spray household&#xD;&#xA;   vinegar on your weeds. The acidic water kills them especially on&#xD;&#xA;   sunny days.&#xD;&#xA; - Remove infested plants to prevent the pests from spreading to&#xD;&#xA;   neighboring plants.&#xD;&#xA; - Use botanical insecticide-Pyrethrum spray or dust is made from a&#xD;&#xA;   daisy-like flower grown in Kenya. The flower is ground into powder.&#xD;&#xA;   It protects against ants, aphids, roaches, fleas &amp; flies but is not&#xD;&#xA;   good for cats.&#xD;&#xA; - Place traps around the outside of your garden. Pheromone traps&#xD;&#xA;   attract insects during their mating cycles, and yellow sticky traps&#xD;&#xA;   are effective against flying insects such as aphids, whiteflies and&#xD;&#xA;   fungus gnats." />

Now I assume this is no problem in your case, since you speak of waste &quot;heat&quot;, hinting that the rest of the environment is *colder*, so you have a difference. Nevertheless, it is something to consider during construction of any such device. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of waste water: the most obvious solution would be to let cold water flow through the (hot) waste water, thus allow the cold water to heat up. The cold water (now warmer) is then used as new clean hot water in the appliance. In the case of showers (or comparable), this would mean you'd have to add less hot water from the boiler, thus saving energy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For other applications, you could use [thermoelectric generators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_generator) (or more general, [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect), which will convert heat directly into electricity. You can buy such things pretty much everywhere; they're pretty cheap and come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, allowing you to effectively utilize many sources of waste heat as power source. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are however not very efficient. A much more efficient approach seems to be the [Stirling engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine). Granted, it's not as elegant as thermoelectric generators: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - it has moving parts, therefore, it sustains losses due to friction&#xD;&#xA; - has steeper maintenance requirements&#xD;&#xA; - it's more complicated so has a steeper learning curve to build yourself&#xD;&#xA; - it needs to be attached to a generator since it doesn't generate electricity itself&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it is so much more efficient that if ever I have the time and money, I'd put my money on these things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also interesting: the [vortex tube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_tube). This thing allows you to split a stream of gas into hot and cold components, with 100% efficiency (provided you have a pressurized waste product :). A version for fluids exists as well, which, when used with waste water, would allow you to increase the temperature difference. But again, I haven't calculated anything; I'm not sure whether this would increase the total power output by the Stirling engine + turbine contraption. Still, it's an interesting thing to keep in mind. " />

However that still rounds to 2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second question would then be what is a sustainable population?  &#xD;&#xA;And is that a constant number or does it change due to better use of natural resources?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the world is currently overpopulated. And whether that is in fact true or not doesn't really matter in my opinion. Why should we strive to have as much people as we can feed on this planet? I don't think it makes a better living if we are with 9 billion instead of 6 billion. Actually the quality of life seems to suffer from having the maximum number of people. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you want to increase the quality of life, you need to have a slight decline in population. You don't want to decline too fast, since that has severe social and economic consequences. Who will look after you when you are old? Who will invest in new buildings if there is no one to buy them in the future? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think 2 children is a nice figure to aim for. It keeps the population more or less constant, with a slow decline due to the fact that not everybody will have children. &#xD;&#xA;" />

This transition, may surprise many companies waiting in the wings for signs of life in the global economy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Second, an increasingly global workforce may require a strategic approach to mobility and cross-border/cross-functional collaboration. This includes the provision of work arrangement options that engage employees across all demographics, with most employees expecting their employer to offer them more tools, flexibility, and choice. Further, multiple generations in the workplace are already causing friction as work styles shift from status quo to status carpe diem. As younger colleagues step up into management roles, they may likely make decisions that include the use of virtual work practices for their teams.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;______________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Related:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Usefulness and relevance varies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[How Telecommuting Lets Workers Mobilize for Sustainability](http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/02/17/how-telecommuting-lets-workers-mobilize-sustainability?page=0%2C0)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[US Government fuel economy site](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Specific sustainability comment](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/consres.shtml)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[AT&amp;T sustainability report with Telecommuting reference](http://www.att.com/gen/landing-pages?pid=22872)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[USCF sustainability page with links to telecommuting guidelines](http://sustainability.ucsf.edu/1.196)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [USCF telecommuting guidelines](http://ucsfhr.ucsf.edu/index.php/policies/article/telecommuting-guidelines-and-procedures1/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Policies](http://ucsfhr.ucsf.edu/index.php/policies/cat/site/Telecommuting/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Syracuse university sustainability &amp; telecommuting page](http://humanresources.syr.edu/worklife/fws_telecommuting.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Cornell - sadly bare page!!!](http://assembly.cornell.edu/Suggestions/2008FallSustainabilityTelecommuting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[THE TELEWORKER - overview re sustainability &amp; other sectors](http://archive.teleworkexchange.com/teleworker-09-10f.asp)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[UN, global e-sustainability reprot {dated}](http://omec.uab.cat/Documentos/TIC_desenvolupament/0132.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;______________________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_____________________________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Addressing:** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ... some reasoned arguments about Telecommuting in sustainablity terms - how much of an energy costs in there to working at home compared with commuting X miles in Y minutes by Z mode of transportation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**by commenting on factors involved:**  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some jobs it just doesn't work, of course. For example, a commercial cleaner is never going to &quot;work from home&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have largely here just referred to &quot;cost&quot; rather than energy cost except in a few specific cases. While energy cost percentage of a given item or service varies with circumstance, in an open market where other factors have not been purposefully brought to bear (directed taxes and duties, marketing 'spin', cartels,...) , energy cost is a significant and *very roughly* constant proportion of total cost.   &#xD;&#xA;[eg Oil costs nothing when it is in the ground. The major part of its market cost is the cost of exploration, field development, extraction and transportation. These in turn can be broken down into components where energy cost ends up playing a major part. And ultimately you get back to the cost of oil as the main factor in the cost of oil :-).   &#xD;&#xA;The price of diamonds and the cost of diamonds are essentially unrelated.   &#xD;&#xA;The cost of Nike products includes a large &quot;Just do it&quot; factor.]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Starting with just &quot;cost&quot; is often an OK enough proxy for energy costs while a first impression is gained of what other factors are involved. This can then be refined as required. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It depends on distance involved.  &#xD;&#xA;Take the two  extremes and you get different answers, indicating that there is a crossover point at some stage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At one extreme, if your home was  &quot;just around the corner&quot; from work premises then duplication of facilities would be liable to be inefficient. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - At the other extreme, once work-location and company physical location are separated, you can communicate across a city or across the world just as easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - But as distance rises the cost and time for sending physical objects varies, so the importance and frequency of doing this affects the crossover point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Various factors discussed below modify where this crossover point will be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How much distance matters depends on job type and how well you can operate at a large distance. Distance can increase efficiency of telecommuting because of the cost savings of you not having to travel, and increase the cost on the occasions when you do have to travel. Within a city or regional area factors include type of job, traffic densities, distance between the locations, quality of transport infrastructure and more. It is reasonably common in Asia for people to travel for 2 or more hours per day in each direction, but many take far less than this. I do not know the expectations in say the US or Europe but trip times of half an hour to one hour + would be usual here (Auckland, New Zealand's largest city) and two hours would be unusual but not unknown. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have to send papers or equipment or samples or work output then distance and time taken rise in 'steps'. Sending materiel across a city takes hours to a day by courier. Sending by post often next day or two days. Shorter times cost more as distance rises (&quot;1 hour&quot; couriers etc). In most 'developed countries' across a country sending by courier takes maybe a day or two, possibly three (depends on local factors). Sending small items (up to 10 or 20 kg say*) or papers across the world takes 3 days if you are happy to pay between an hour and a day of equivalent salary (depending on what your local earning levels are) or weeks to many weeks at lower but non-trivial cost. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your job depends only on &quot;communications&quot; and you seldom or never need to send physical objects then it's more efficient to tele-commute in extreme cases. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To complicate the mix throw in worker trustability, ability to supervise and ability to obtain assistance or guidance when needed. Ability tos share with others you are working with or for can be critically important or of minimal relevance depending on the job involved. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So  while, as noted above , somewhere there will be a &quot;crossover point&quot; it is so influenced by the above factors and many more that a simple (or even quite complex) formula is only going to be a starting point, and a study is likely to be required in each case where factors differ markedly from others already in operation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;____________________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two extreme examples:  &#xD;&#xA;In a recent TV program here the owner managers of a UK based company, who live in New Zealand (12,000 miles and about two days away) were discussing their customer helpline operation. The job requires &quot;only&quot; a 'telephone' connection and computer access.   &#xD;&#xA;Up until 7:59 pm each day, UK time,  this is operated by UK company staff. At 8pm you will be answered by a company employee in New Zealand. The calls are not outsourced. The people who talk to customers are product experts and company employees. They have access to the same company computer databases and resources. Interestingly, while they are 12,000 miles away from the customers, in this instance they still work in an office in NZ, and not at their homes. On the one hand the company has its NZ employees &quot;tele-commute&quot; 12,000 miles, but have not taken the final step of allowing them to take the final step, even though technology would allow it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am close to but not quite at the extreme end. I sit at my desk or workshop in New Zealand. As required I work almost simultaneously at various places elsewhere on earth - at present in USA, Canada, Serbia and China as required. Nobody that I work for or with is in NZ with me. Commuting is fun enough, when I occasionally get to do it, but there is no daily &quot;travelling to work&quot;. When you take the energy costs of travel plus a proportion of accommodation &amp; other costs involved (to allow for their energy costs) it adds up to what would be a modest but significant transportation budget if I travelled within my own city. But the annual travel hours are significantly lower, even allowing for the duration of international travel. Occasionally samples and prototypes do have to be sent across the world (usually NZ-China) costing time and money. But, quite apart from the fact that it would be impossible to be in all the places I need to be if I did not work &quot;remotely&quot;, the cost of 'working from home' is lower than it would be for me to work on the far side of my own city. I think it probable that by any metric that you choose, it is lower cost for me to &quot;telecommute&quot; than not to. I have not discussed the  cost of work premises or equipment or the affects of tax concessions for 'home offices' etc as they further complicate what is essentially a very broad overview. . &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_____________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Many major international courier companies offer &quot;Jumbo&quot; boxes with 10 kg or 20 kg maximum weight and &quot;all you can fit in&quot; volume constraint. These are often superbly cost effective if you need to send more than about 50% of their weight in the volume provided. " />

Applications that interface with these smart meters may be more useful if they also include electricity loads, especially with some granularity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think these little gadgets can have some zip that might appeal to some that aren't traditionally as engaged with sustainability issues.  This sort of gift would probably be taken more graciously than evangelizing to them and telling them to reduce to one refrigerator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, what kind of useful insight can I expect from a smart thermostat or meter application beyond the obvious - switch to LEDs and reduce to one refrigerator?  Do those insights justify the cost of the device - in terms of economic and environmental savings from reduced energy consumption?" />

It has lower embodied energy than fiberglass [(112 MJ/m^3)](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/cbpr/documents/pdfs/ee-coefficients.pdf).  This can easily be used in attics where settling isn't much of a concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wet Cellulose (wet)** insulation is very similar to blown cellulose except that it is blown in wet so that it binds to whatever it hits and doesn't settle over time.  This is fairly standard, but can only be around 4&quot; thick before you have to start embedding some plastic or other support to help hold up the insulation.  It is string enough to not sag, but not when spanning large gaps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Styrofoam** insulation is often used under foundations, but also in walls.  It is strong and easy to install, but the manufacture still creates many [harmful chemicals](http://www.earthresource.org/campaigns/capp/capp-styrofoam.html), to both those manufacturing it and the general air quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Rice Hulls** can be used in a similar was as blown cellulose and has similar problems.

If one insulation takes twice as long to install, perhaps you'd have been better off installing the easy/cheap one, and putting the rest of the money in solar panels, organic food or any number of other places.  Extra thick walls to support extra insulation will (depending on your wall construction method) require extra wall material (wider studs in a framed wall).  That could also be factored in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Thermal Mass**&#xD;&#xA;Another thing to consider is thermal mass.  It is helpful to have things like concrete, earth, brick and water inside (or a part of your inside wall).  This is most helpful in places which have large temperature swings.  In these places if it is 70 during the day and 20 at night, your thermal mass can hold your house at daytime temperatures all night, without having to turn on the heat (and visa-versa in the summer with cool nights).

You can just pick your favorite insulation and make sure the walls are designed to use it effectively. From a heating standpoint, it doesn't really matter if you use fiberglass, foam, insulated concrete forms, or blown-in cellulose as long as the wall assemblies have the R-value your looking for and everything is built and installed correctly. In a cold climate, reducing heating fuel consumption will have a far greater impact over the useful life of the insulation than choosing &quot;green&quot; materials. That said, some materials are clearly more sustainable than others. Refer to [Zach's answer](http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/897/462) for more information on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're buying an existing but under-insulated home you might want blown-in cellulose because it can be installed in uninsulated cavities without tearing apart the wall. It's also very simple to add a layer in the attic. If/when you need to replace the siding, you might want to install foam boards between the wall and the new siding. This is also a good option for masonry or concrete walls. Wood-framed structures will probably give you more options for adding insulation than masonry or concrete walls will because wood-framed walls have cavities that can be filled with just about any type of insulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also keep in mind that insulation only prevents heat transfer through itself. Studs between insulated cavities will conduct heat better than you'd like no matter what. Ideally, your home will have a continuous &quot;shell&quot; of insulation that is broken only by windows, doors, plumbing penetrations, and exhaust outlets/air intakes. That said, some insulation is better than none, and at some point the cost just isn't worth it unless you have a whole lot of money to throw around." />

Meat, fish and oily stuff can be processed, but often goes bad and stink before the worms have had a chance to process it. In bins without a lid meat and fish may also attract flies and maggots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The easiest solution for cooked food probably is to preprocess it in a [Bokashi bin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost#Bokashi). Micro-organisms in the bin will break down the things that are more difficult to compost (like meat and oils). After two weeks you can process the Bokashi bin contents further by throwing it on a compost heap, in a vermicompost bin, or simply by burying it in your garden.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the animal feces, they actually can be placed on a compost heap too but the reason why it is not recommended is that animal feces often contain pathogens that can be dangerous to people if they are not processed in the right manner. Feces from rabbits, hamsters and guinea pigs are rather harmless and can be placed on your heap safely. Feces from dogs and cats are more troublesome. Cat feces for example may contain the Toxoplasma gondii parasite that is dangerous for people with a weak immune system and for pregnant women." />

In fact, Cenovus, who signed a 10 year agreement to purchase ~2740 tonnes CO2/day from the Sask Power project above, currently gets 5,500 tons of CO2 per day from North Dakota.  Sask Power CEO claims they can sell their CO2 for **$15-50 per ton** ([Calgary Herald](http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=4af2f49b-831d-4a28-89b6-c8c9b5afc7c7)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Why EOR Might Be Thwarted By Production of Shale Gas and Oil**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two maps below show the top 50  largest proved oil reserves in the US and then a map of shale oil and gas formations.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would seem that our largest oil reserves are in Texas, California, and the Northern Great Plains.

According to a [2012 study in Environmental Science and Technology](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es2040015), 80% of US capacity for CO2 geological sequestration (ie deep saline aquifers) exists in shale gas reserves.  Unfortunately, the fracking process undermines the ability of the aquifer to meaningfully sequester the carbon - the CO2 would escape through the tiny cracks used to extract the natural gas.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cg1wW.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Psgyv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CYnHu.png" />

We've made them from old curtains, old bedsheets, etc., pretty much all &quot;recycled&quot; materials.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They've been working perfectly fine, but every time I wash out the poop I can't help but wonder: compared to disposable, compostable diapers, is the ecological footprint of washable diapers *really* smaller?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a few things to consider here: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I hand-wash the diapers in lukewarm water with some detergent, prior to machine washing them. Sometimes I put them in the dryer (I don't live in a climate that always allows air drying, and I kinda *need* the diapers quickly after washing), but let's leave that step out of consideration for now.&#xD;&#xA; - There are these cover-pants things, that you have to put over the actual diaper to make everything watertight. They contain some plastics, and they have to be washed too. However, on like 10 diapers you'd use 1 of these things. They're pretty indestructible, so we got them second-hand, and we plan on selling them on to the next parents when our kids grow out, but at some point they have to be disposed of...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The kids run around bare-butted a lot these days, so we're using like 3 a day or so. Back when they were babies it used to be somewhere around 10 a day. That contrasts with the diapers being *much* easier to wash when they are babies; toddlers tend to produce far more &quot;sticky&quot; material :) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway -- we also used disposable ones in the past, made from sustainable materials and compostable, but I really don't know how to start comparing them.

Products change all the time so your rating should be revised often as well. If you want your rating to be anything more than a very rough estimate, you'll have to limit yourself to certain products, a geographical location, or a small set of features to rate, or else the amount of data may be overwhelming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. **Different people care about different things.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Someone who feels that the well-being of laborers is very important might not care for animal welfare or vice versa, so one specific label may be more interesting to a person than one label covering multiple aspects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously a global multi-aspect label has to take these two points into account.&#xD;&#xA;Here is a list of things I think you will need when you start such a label from scratch: &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  1. **A clear and well-defined set of rules on how you derive the rating of a product.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The question here is how precise do you want to be and what is technologically possible? For example, [LCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment)s provides a good measure of many (environment-related) sustainability aspects but are only available for 'simple' products like glass bottles, diapers and clothing, not for more complex products. Also LCAs are geographically dependent so that's also something to take into account. A second question is how do you derive the exact score of a product? For example, what will be the overall rating of a product with a good score on ecological footprint but very low on socio-economics?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. **Reliable methods to gather the necessary information.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Deciding on a rating system is one thing, using it is another. The difficulty here is from where do you get the information you want and how do you get it? There are many companies that do not disclose information about how a product is made exactly, which raw materials are being used in their products or where they buy the materials. You'll probably want companies to cooperate and provide this information, but what about products from companies that don't cooperate?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  3. **People who will reliably assess and rate the products in a uniform manner.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  To rate all products all over the world you will need lots of people doing this. Perhaps some sort of co-creation / [wisdom-of-the-crowds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds) scheme is the way to go here, but you'll have to be careful for manipulation because if the label is succesful and widely recognised the stakes may be high for certain manufacturers and sellers.&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  4. **A way to inform the public about the rating given to products**&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;  You can try and get a product's rating displayed on the product itself, but manufacturers that make products with low ratings will most likely not cooperate. Alternatively you can try to convince third-party sellers (e.g. supermarkets, shops) to disclose this information and display it on their shelves. Of course you can always put the information online but this is probably less effective as you won't reach spontaneous shoppers and people without internet access.&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  5. **Support from the public.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Without public support, your chances of convincing companies, organisations and/or governments to cooperate and getting it certified will most likely fail. &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  6. **Funding**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Obviously you need capital to somehow get all of this started.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to getting the label certified globally, I don't really know how you should approach that. Different countries/governments/organisations have different goals and ideas, so I suspect many won't be interested or won't agree with the way you rate products. Also a well-recognized and globally-accepted label won't be in the interest of many manufacturers so it's likely that several companies will start a big lobbying campaign against the label if it becomes succesful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One final note, rather than starting a global multi-aspect rating label from scratch, I think it would be much easier to try and cooperate with existing labels and see if you can combine the most reliable and useful labels and use them to derive your own rating." />

This saves a lot of water (no prewashing poopy diapers) and we use fewer diapers since she doesn't get them dirty every time she wears them.  This works for both reusable and disposable.  She almost never poops in her diapers any more.  She is only 10 months old and we started this around 8 months.  She stopped pooping in her diapers immediately after letting her use the potty.  All we do is every hour or two, when we would normally change her diaper, we take her diaper off and set her on her potty and let her play with a toy or two for a few minutes.  She normally pees right away.  If we hear her making pooping noises, we take her to her potty.  Supposedly, we are actually training babies to be ok with peeing and pooping in their diapers and that most babies would much rather do it in a potty from a very early age.

Using rain water and/or solar hot water would also help the energy use be lower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the topic of energy use and diapers, we've also had pretty good success teaching our daughter to pee and poo in a little potty rather than in the diaper.  This saves a lot of water (no prewashing poopy diapers) and we use fewer diapers since she doesn't get them dirty every time she wears them.  This works for both reusable and disposable.  She almost never poops in her diapers any more.  She is only 10 months old and we started this around 8 months.  She stopped pooping in her diapers immediately after letting her use the potty.  All we do is every hour or two, when we would normally change her diaper, we take her diaper off and set her on her potty and let her play with a toy or two for a few minutes.  She normally pees right away.  If we hear her making pooping noises, we take her to her potty.  Supposedly, we are actually training babies to be ok with peeing and pooping in their diapers and that most babies would much rather do it in a potty from a very early age.  By the time they get older and we start training them to use the potty, they have already gotten used to their diaper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=789465&amp;page=3" />

They test products for how &quot;good&quot; they are. Products then receive a mark (grade) and these results are published in a magazine (which costs money). If the product gets a good mark, the manufacturer may decide to stick a label on their products. If not, well, then nobody knows how good or bad the product is and the consumer has to find out for himself (e.g. via reviews, personal testing, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The appeal for making labels like FairTrade, MSC, FSC, etc., is obvious: The manufacturer will likely be easy to convince to stick the label on his products. (As long as you can convince him, that you are a label the consumer cares about, that is.) This alone requires a great marketing campaign, preferably with TV spots that explain even to the layman, why your label is something worth paying attention to. Anything more ambitious (like the organic labels) require support from the government and, presumably, a very serious source of funding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a small scale, I think you can already work wonders with marketing products, which you know to be good, never mind whether they have some &quot;organic&quot;, &quot;sustainably produced&quot;, &quot;whatever&quot; label. Telling the customers about the company and the production process is becoming more and more fashionable, but there is an inherent appeal to sustainably produced products. I would say any marketing campaign for these type of products (which are deemed to be successful, if done correctly) will already change consumer behaviour, which of course is your motivation for creating this label in the first place." />

The maturation time of an aspen poplar forest is around 60 years in our climate.  That gives me a 1.6 ton/year gross production over the life cycle of the forest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So by one measure, I could extract something like 1 ton of biomass from the forest per acre per year, and do this indefinitely. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So that could be considered sustainable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But wait:  I take that wood away, and burn it or make chip board or fence posts (bad idea, rots to fast) and with the celluose I'm taking small quantities of Phosphorus and potassium.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Indeed:  places where they have done intensive forestry, after about 3 generations of trees being removed, they have problems with mineral deficiencies.

Assuming this is no problem, my best bet would be that a mix of Eisenia Fetida and Eisenia Hortensis has the highest throughput rate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Long answer**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most research on vermicomposting focuses on reproduction and grow rates of different worms species. It is assumed that higher reproduction rates means more juvenile worms which in turn means a higher processing rate. I'm not entirely sure if this assumption is true but since we have nothing else to go on I'll stick with reproduction and grow rates for my answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mixing worm species can be done just fine as long as you can keep the conditions in your bin suited for all species involved. Chances are however that the conditions will be more favorable for one particular type of worm and that this worm will flourish and the population of the other worms will decline, so not all combinations of worm species will result in an effective mix.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most research on vermicomposting worms favor Eisenia Fetida (a.k.a red worm) for a number of reasons. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Fetida worms have fast reproduction and grow rates, &#xD;&#xA;  2. they tolerate and can survive under a wide range of circumstances, &#xD;&#xA;  3. they don't mind disturbances of their enviroment (at least not so much as other worm species like the Eudrilus Eugeniae). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is for these reasons that the Fetida worm has become [the most popular one](http://www.wormcomposting.ca/worms/red-worms-eisenia-fetida/) for vermicomposting. A bin with only Fetida worms certainly is a good choice to get a good throughput rate under different circumstances. The only problem with Fetida worms is that they tend to stay close to the surface. They don't eat food that is buried deep into a bin. That's why I think you might be able to get a slightly higher throughput rate if you add Eisenia Hortensis (a.k.a. Dendobaena Veneta or European nightcrawler) worms. Hortensis worms like it a bit more wet and colder than Fetida worms, but both species will do ok in circumstances that are a bit less than ideal. Additionally, Hortensis worms like to spread out all over the bin so if you add food both at the top as well as deeper into the bin you'll get a larger surface of active worms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there has been some discussion about Hortensis worms. Research done in the late 80s and early 90s showed that the Hortensis had a rather low reproduction and grow rate, but in the late 90s this has been questioned by a number of worm farmers. Several people have reported that they found that the Hortensis worm can grow and reproduce just as fast as the Fetida  and claim the different results can be explained by the difference in bin conditions or in the food supplied to the worms (see [here](http://vermicomposters.ning.com/group/eiseniahortensisfarmers), [here](http://www.redwormcomposting.com/worm-composting/european-nightcrawler-cocoons/#comment-3489) and [here](http://vermicomposters.ning.com/profiles/blogs/eisenia-hortensis-european)). AFAIK the high reproduction rate of the Hortensis has not been proven scientifically yet but the fact is that the Hortensis worm has gained quite a bit of popularity in the last 10 years. If the Hortensis worm indeed has a similar reproduction and grow rate then it may outperform the Fetida worm when it comes to throughput rates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like I said in my quick answer, ultimately it will depend on the circumstances in your bin(s) and your abilities to keep those circumstances ideal for one or more types of worms. If you have a rather wet bin, it might be best just to use only Hortensis worms. If you have a lot of temperature changes the Fetida worm may be better. If your bin is kept at a constant temperature of around 25 Celsius (77 F) a bin with only Eudrilus Eugeniae might be the better choice. The best way to find out what works for you is simply to experiment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT:** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I just found this very interesting answer of Robert Moore at the bottom of [this post](http://www.researchgate.net/post/Producing_a_hybrid_species_of_composting_worms) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What I have found is that combined breeding does increase the breadth of microbial species versus that found in single-species breeding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is mainly the saprophytic microbial activity that composts, not the earthworm per se.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The rate of decomposition is therefore a matter of the diversity and density of the microbial community along with how many earthworm mouths are present for a given volume of bedding which should be at C:N of 30:1 for maximum microbial reproduction within newly-prepared bedding, and harvested at 25:1" />

The only other option in many cases is for whoever manages the facility's waste to sort the good from the bad by hand, and that is generally not feasible. Some recycling centers are more strict than others about contamination, but even single-stream recycling systems won't take a load if there is more than a certain % of food, liquid, and trash. If a load of recycling is determined to be &quot;unrecyclable&quot; at the recycling center, it will be disposed of as trash, often at the expense of the customer (especially if the customer is a school or business that contracts directly with the recycling service). Hence environmentally-aware college students should remind their intoxicated friends to use the trash can because vomit is not recyclable (yes, I have witnessed this). In general, though, I think in the USA it's safe to assume that if the contents of the bins can be recycled, they will be recycled. Most companies won't spend money on recycling bins unless they actually plan to use them. So the answer to your question is yes, but only if you trust the American people to follow directions." />

Many would consider that you are still getting the benefits that the govt provides, such as use of roads, police, and even national defense, so taxing every person a certain amount for these is justified. These things are all expensive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Leasing:** It might suit you better to try to find someone who will lease you a certain amount of land with some particular business arrangement. For example, if you planted and harvested a supply of firewood each year for the owner, you might have some land left over for your own purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tax optimisation:** Another thing you could look at is finding land that has particularly low taxes (eg if the tax is value based, then find low value land, or if the tax is state-based, move to a state with lower tax).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Joining with a community of like minded people may provide a lower tax burden for each individual. In New Zealand, some of the taxes are based on the number of separate dwellings, so having a very large house with several families in would result in lower tax per person (however, if you separated the house into individual units, you'd increase your tax). Other taxes in NZ are based on land value, and whether or not you have a connection to the sewerage system. I remember hearing about one case where a land owner was forced to pay a share of the installation of sewerage pipes down his street when he didn't even want to connect to it, so look out for that kind of activity on residential fringes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Compromise:** If you explain your situation and invite people that you work for to donate an amount that they can afford, you might find you earn enough to cover your tax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Note:** To try to avoid these kind of problems getting worse for your grandkids, get involved in some kind of democratic lobby group to help prevent the problems growing over time and push for improvement instead." />

The amount of impact will depend on your exact circumstance, but you will have some impact somewhere: through your elected representative, through a national political party, through a religious body, or through economic influence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you've identified a person of influence in one of those spheres, next find out what motivates them, what sort of language they use to describe problems and solutions, and what their priorities are.  Then, explain to them how catastrophic anthropogenic global warming will worsen some of those problems; and give them three good tactical approaches to preventing that from happening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###An example&#xD;&#xA;In a representative democracy, there are routes to power through party-political structures, and through elected members. One can join a political party that is free of policies you find completely unacceptable, and work within it to develop policies to mitigate global warming. If the party's main message is one of protecting the weak and creating an equitable society, then your approach would be to talk about how catastrophic global warming would make the poorest suffer, and how it would divert resources away from tackling wealth inequity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The three tactical approaches might be:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. working with international partners to put in place rapid decarbonisation targets;&#xD;&#xA;2. transferring part of the source of taxation from something that is held to be a good thing, such as employment, onto greenhouse-gas emissions; and combining this with an equivalent import duty on goods and services that contain [embedded carbon][1].&#xD;&#xA;3. introduce capital grants to low-income households, to enable them to buy photovoltaic panels extremely cheaply, and then to sell their surplus power back to the grid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Personal impact&#xD;&#xA;For almost all of us, our own personal emissions are very small in the scheme of things. And yet, if each of us can take personal actions to halve our total greenhouse gas impact, then global emissions will halve. So together, our impact can be huge. Furthermore, wherever there are some market forces in place, then changing your demand from high-carbon goods and services to low-carbon ones, will incentivise commerce and industry to decarbonise at the margins. The main thing is to work out where your biggest personal impact is, and to start there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###An example&#xD;&#xA;For anyone who flies or drives a lot, their travel is probably a very large part of their personal carbon footprint. If the long trips can be shifted to train, and the shorter drives can be shifted to bus, tram, metro, walking or cycling, then that can have a big impact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For anyone living a climate where a large part of the year requires space-heating, and that's done through gas, oil, coal or high-carbon electricity, then investing in insulation and reducing draughts should save you money in the long run, and will reduce your personal emissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[If you have a choice of electricity provider, then in some cases, changing provider can make a difference.][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.yesmagazine.org/blogs/richard-conlin/but-what-about-embedded-carbon&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/682/48" />

(source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidacloprid#Authorized_uses))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I read that Imidacloprid is taken up by plants and trees and remains present in their flowers or seeds so I suspect there is no way of knowing for sure whether a tree, plant, flower bulb, or seed contains neonicotinoids without labtests.

The only other option in many cases is for whoever manages the facility's waste to sort the good from the bad by hand, and that is generally not feasible. Some recycling centers are more strict than others about contamination, but even single-stream recycling systems won't take a load if there is more than a certain % of food, liquid, and trash. If a load of recycling is determined to be &quot;unrecyclable&quot; at the recycling center, it will be disposed of as trash, often at the expense of the customer (especially if the customer is a school or business that contracts directly with the recycling service). Hence environmentally-aware college students should remind their intoxicated friends to use the trash can because vomit is not recyclable (yes, I have witnessed this). In general, though, I think in the USA it's safe to assume that if the contents of the bins can be recycled, they will be recycled. Most companies won't spend money on recycling bins unless they actually plan to use them. So the answer to your question is yes, but only if you trust the American people to follow directions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Waste Management [sends food-contaminated materials to the landfill](http://www.thinkgreen.com/recycle-what-detail?sec=organics-food-waste&amp;prod=food-waste&amp;tab=resources). The page linked explains the effect of grease and oils on paper recycling, and exploration of the site confirmed that WM sends food-contaminated plastics to the landfill. The site also indicates that food impacts aluminum foil recycling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As another example of how impurities effect recycling, Pacific Steel &amp; Recycling in Havre, MT has very strict guidelines about sorting papers and cardboard because mixed newsprint/office paper bales are worth much less than pure newsprint or office paper, transport costs are high, and recycling volume is low in a rural town of ~9600 (source: conversation with an employee). And those are impurities that don't completely ruin the material for recycling the way food does.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As alluded to above, recycling companies make a profit by turning waste items into raw materials for manufacturing. So as long as what they receive isn't too badly contaminated, they do recycle it. If a business contracts with a recycling company for on-site pick-up, you can be sure that uncontaminated loads will be recycled." />

Basil helps ward off whiteflies, which are harmful to tomatoes, and oregano can help protect tomato and cucumber plants. Carrots and sunflowers help deter pests from your tomato plants. Nasturtiums and marigolds help protect both tomato and cucumber plants.&#xD;&#xA; - Add natural predators. Soldier beetles, tachinid flies and braconid wasps feed on striped cucumber beetles, which can help protect your cucumber plants. Parasitic wasps will   help eliminate leafminers and stink bugs from your tomato plants.  Bigeyed bugs and minute pirate bugs attack tomato fruitworms that can destroy the fruit and stems of your tomato plants. Attract insect predators by growing plants that feature small flowers, such as daisies, dill and coneflower. These plants will encourage predators of insects and beneficial insects including ladybugs, nematodes, bats and birds.&#xD;&#xA; - Cover your organic vegetables-Spunbound Polyester Rowcover keeps out pests but allows light, air &amp; water to get through.&#xD;&#xA; - Spray neem oil - Oils &amp; seeds from the neem tree have been used in&#xD;&#xA;   India for centuries. It's a great, low-toxicity insecticide &amp;&#xD;&#xA;   fungicide.&#xD;&#xA; - Spray vinegar - Spray household vinegar on your weeds. The acidic water kills them &#xD;&#xA;   especially on sunny days.&#xD;&#xA; - Use botanical insecticide-Pyrethrum spray or dust is made from a&#xD;&#xA;   daisy-like flower grown in Kenya. The flower is ground into powder.&#xD;&#xA;   It protects against ants, aphids, roaches, fleas &amp; flies but is not&#xD;&#xA;   good for cats.&#xD;&#xA; - Weed your garden well and regularly to minimize hiding places for&#xD;&#xA;   insect pests and to prevent the weeds from competing with your&#xD;&#xA;   vegetables for water and nutrients.  &#xD;&#xA; - Remove infested plants to prevent the pests from spreading to&#xD;&#xA;   neighboring plants.&#xD;&#xA; - Place traps around the outside of your garden. Pheromone traps&#xD;&#xA;   attract insects during their mating cycles, and yellow sticky traps&#xD;&#xA;   are effective against flying insects such as aphids, whiteflies and&#xD;&#xA;   fungus gnats." />

Try to use 4th or 5th gear in town and 3rd when turning around, and you soon will see how much effective the consumption will be.

But according to my knowledge about the patterns promoted to the media and the observations how they apply to my acquaintances, only a small part of it id the food that is actually spoiled. Most of that is thrown away because the expiry date is reached, someone has cooked too much or the most trivially is bored with some food and don't want to eat it to the end. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My tips and recommendations are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Never buy too much. Learn how much you are able to eat and how much do you need to buy. Don't improvise in shop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Don't throw food away just because expiry date is reached. Note that the expiry date is made only to remove liability from producers and it's calculated for the most pessimistic scenario of keeping the product (too high temperature, exposition to light etc.). I've eaten a lot of products months, and in some cases (products in cans or jars) even years after the expiry date, and I never had problems because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Be disciplined. If you prepare something, eat it to the end. If you can't eat more, wait an hour. If you still can't eat more, store it in fridge. Never throw something away even if the potato cooked the previous day don't taste as well as that cooked right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4) In case of products that spoil very quick in kitchen, such as fruits and vegetables, buy them regularly and in small portions that you can eat within 1- max 3-days. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5) Dry bread can be powdered and used for chops or some other meal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6) Sweet fruits that are rotten but not moldy can be used to prepare a hooch. In worst case it can be used as fuel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7) Cheese or sausages that doesn't smell well, but don't stink, can be eaten if you fry them. In outdoor camps if we find something that isn't looking very well after a few days in the rucksack, we fry that in campfire, without negative consequences." />

A COP of 3 will compete with or beat an 80% efficient furnace with a duct system for fuel efficiency.

But, for many people, these tend to be problem areas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Food** - what type of diet do you have?  Meat, then poultry and fish, and then fruits and veggies tend to have the biggest impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (not just carbon, but methane from agriculture is a big problem, especially in the &quot;short&quot; term of the next 100 years).  Note: *locality* tends to be an overrated aspect of your food's impact, as transportation is a fairly small part of the energy required to produce food (it does matter, but not as much as choice of food types).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Heating** - how do you heat or cool your home?  Homes like apartments or condos are fundamentally easier to keep at a constant temperature, both because they tend to be smaller, and because each unit doesn't have 5 sides that are exposed to the outside air.  Are you using a relatively efficient technology like a heat pump, or an inefficient one like electric baseboard heating?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Local Transport** - do you drive, or take the bus/walk?  If you drive, do you drive electric (most efficient, and best for GHG if you buy green energy), use biodiesel (not as thermodynamically *efficient*, but most of the carbon released was already in the air), drive a hybrid, a petro-diesel or gasoline car?  *For the most part*, that's the order of least to most impact on global warming (with each general technology having a range depending on many factors).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Flying** - airline travel is horrible for climate change.  Not only does it consume massive quantities of fossil fuels in a short period of time, but it's going to be much more difficult to *green* commercial aviation than it is to *green* automobiles, because power-to-weight ratio is so critical in airplanes.  There isn't a huge difference in impact between flying and driving to the same remote destination, but the choice really is whether to take those long trips at all.  If you fly, especially across oceans (e.g. regularly for business or vacations), your *raw* carbon footprint will be large, no matter what else you do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **General Consumption** - do you buy a lot of *stuff*?  Toys for kids.  New tools for your home or garden.  New appliances with more features.  Big TVs.  New clothes when old ones are out of style.  Everything we buy takes energy to make.  When we throw it away (or even recycle it), it causes more energy to be used, and greenhouse gases to be produced (e.g. trash decomposing in landfills).  Getting into the mindset of buying only what you **need**, not just what you want, and keeping things you buy for a long time (or fixing them when they break), can reduce your impact substantially.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Children** - this isn't going to make people happy, as it's a taboo subject, but the number of children you have has a huge impact on climate change.  It's important not to get lured into the trap of considering only *per capita* carbon footprints, because the environment knows nothing about the number of people ... only the total amount of greenhouse gas we produce.  More people mean more emissions, and at 7 billion and counting, it's simply no longer a reasonable argument to contend that we need to produce 2+ children per couple to sustain the human race.  Parents also frequently fall into the trap of thinking that because they live an eco-friendly lifestyle, their children will, too, when grown.  Kids are influenced by their parents, but also by the society they live in.  Right now, their society is a profoundly negative influence in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Pets** - while this is another issue that ruffles peoples' feathers, choosing to keep pets is a significant part of many families' impacts.  It certainly depends on the animal, its size, and activity level.  But, a large dog can easily produce as much greenhouse gas in a year (mostly due to the fact that it probably consumes a meat-intensive, high-calorie diet) as an SUV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll try to add some supporting links to this list, as each of the items I mentioned as common *problem* areas could easily be its own topic." />

Note: *locality* tends to be an overrated aspect of your food's impact, as transportation is a fairly small part of the energy required to produce food (it does matter, [but not as much as choice of food types](http://psufoodscience.typepad.com/psu_food_science/files/es702969f.pdf)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Heating** - how do you heat or cool your home?  Homes like apartments or condos are fundamentally easier to keep at a constant temperature, both because they tend to be smaller, and because each unit doesn't have 5 sides that are exposed to the outside air.  Are you using a relatively efficient technology like a heat pump, or an inefficient one like electric baseboard heating?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Local Transport** - do you drive, or take the bus/walk?  If you drive, do you drive electric (most efficient, and best for GHG if you buy green energy), use biodiesel (not as thermodynamically *efficient*, but most of the carbon released was already in the air), drive a hybrid, a petro-diesel or gasoline car?  *For the most part*, that's the order of least to most impact on global warming (with each general technology having a range depending on many factors).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Flying** - airline travel is horrible for climate change.  Not only does it consume massive quantities of fossil fuels in a short period of time, but it's going to be much more difficult to *green* commercial aviation than it is to *green* automobiles, because power-to-weight ratio is so critical in airplanes.  There isn't a huge difference in impact between flying and driving to the same remote destination, but the choice really is whether to take those long trips at all.  If you fly, especially across oceans (e.g. regularly for business or vacations), your *raw* carbon footprint will be large, no matter what else you do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **General Consumption** - do you buy a lot of *stuff*?  Toys for kids.  New tools for your home or garden.  New appliances with more features.  Big TVs.  New clothes when old ones are out of style.  Everything we buy takes energy to make.  When we throw it away (or even recycle it), it causes more energy to be used, and greenhouse gases to be produced (e.g. trash decomposing in landfills).  Getting into the mindset of buying only what you **need**, not just what you want, and keeping things you buy for a long time (or fixing them when they break), can reduce your impact substantially.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Children** - this isn't going to make people happy, as it's a taboo subject, but the number of children you have has a huge impact on climate change.  It's important not to get lured into the trap of considering only *per capita* carbon footprints, because the environment knows nothing about the number of people ... only the total amount of greenhouse gas we produce.  More people mean more emissions, and at 7 billion and counting, it's simply no longer a reasonable argument to contend that we need to produce 2+ children per couple to sustain the human race.  Parents also frequently fall into the trap of thinking that because they live an eco-friendly lifestyle, their children will, too, when grown.  Kids are influenced by their parents, but also by the society they live in.  Right now, their society is a profoundly negative influence in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Pets** - while this is another issue that ruffles peoples' feathers, choosing to keep pets is a significant part of many families' impacts.  It certainly depends on the animal, its size, and activity level.  But, a large dog can easily produce as much greenhouse gas in a year (mostly due to the fact that it probably consumes a meat-intensive, high-calorie diet) as an SUV.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll try to add some supporting links to this list, as each of the items I mentioned as common *problem* areas could easily be its own topic." />

But cardboard is probably more useful as a source of recycled fibers than as a construction material. Building a house out of cardboard would effectively take all of that cardboard out of the recycling loop in order to displace other materials such as wood and straw that can be produced sustainably but are not as easy to recycle. So I think in most cases it isn't a good sustainable building material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to build with the cardboard, for example if it isn't possible to recycle it in your area but you'd like to put it to good use, you'll need to protect it from fire and moisture. You'll probably need to use chemicals for fire protection, but the moisture issue probably just requires some attention to detail when installing vapor and moisture barriers during construction. If the cardboard gets wet, it will weaken and deteriorate, so water protection is very important. It will be nearly impossible to dry the interior of a &quot;solid&quot; cardboard wall if it gets wet. For practical questions about fireproofing and moisture protection, I recommend paying DIY Stack Exchange a quick visit. As far as cardboard's ability to support the weight of a house, I don't think there will be a problem--cardboard is an impressively sturdy material--but it might compress a little bit over time. A *carefully built* cardboard house could be durable and efficient, but you will probably need to get help from construction experts to achieve that goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A cardboard house is possible, but without clever engineering, it's probably not worth building. I strongly encourage you to engage in clever engineering. A durable, efficient cardboard house that beats wood, masonry, concrete, and straw bale in cost, efficient use of materials, and performance would be a truly wonderful invention. But I don't think a straw bale-style cardboard house will do that." />

It is a composite material, in which the hemp fibers are mixed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with other materials to form a strong bond. Hemp has been known to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have a low U-value, that is, it allows a lower heat levels to pass&#xD;&#xA;&gt; through it. The lower the U-value, the better the insulator a material&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is. It has been proven that Hemp insulation has a U-value of .040,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which compares favorably to the U-value rate of 8-inches of insulation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of fiberglass…Hemp's R-value stands at about R-3.5 per inch of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thickness. The more the material limits the flow of heat through it,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the higher its R-value…Insulation made from hemp is a natural buffer.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It helps regulate condensation levels without causing any&#xD;&#xA;&gt; deterioration to thermal efficiency. This eliminates mold which is a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; major challenge to timber frames. Timber has been known to rot and get&#xD;&#xA;&gt; distorted in shape when exposed to high moisture levels especially&#xD;&#xA;&gt; during storage…Hemp also allow buildings to “breathe”. This has the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fantastic benefit of preventing structural damage and potentially&#xD;&#xA;&gt; serious health issues as a result of poor air circulation.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a couple of links I can post per this forum's limits; other websites are hempcrete.ca, thehempbuilder, and many more:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.hempcompany.ie/category-s/1823.htm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://greenspec.buildinggreen.com/blogs/hemcrete-hemp-lime-composite-insulation-walls&#xD;&#xA;" />

Both seem to require more maintenance than static mounts because of the moving parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do tracking mounts improve the return-on-investment of a home solar PV system after installation and maintenance costs are factored in?

At low speeds, open the windows instead (if it's hot); close the windows &amp; wear a jacket (when it's cold). For high speed, close the windows, even when it's hot. At higher speeds the drag created by open windows uses more fuel than the air-conditioning. (See comment by Jay Bazuzi &amp; [reference](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_green_lantern/2010/08/natures_air_conditioner.html) by walker below.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Air pressure of your tyres**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Not the biggest factor, but you decrease wear (long-term benefit) and friction, which saves fuel on the day, so to speak (short-term benefit).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **&quot;Defensive&quot; (anticipatory) driving**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;... meaning try to drive without having to step on the brakes. Keep your distance from the cars in front of you. Take your foot of the gas when the traffic light turned to red. (But remember, braking is more cost-efficient than having an accident. Safety comes first, also for sustainability.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Avoid traffic**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Like the point above, avoid traffic, because in traffic you'll have to brake (for other cars, cyclists, children, traffic lights), which is necessary, but not fuel efficient. Scheduling a longer route around town may well be more efficient (esp. if you are driving defensively and slowly) and doesn't drive you up the wall. (You said that already, I know.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Reduce weight**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;No reason to drive around with unnecessary heavy objects in your trunk. Only take with you what you need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Drive slowly**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Driving twice as fast increases the air resistance 4-fold. Driving faster thus necessarily means you use more fuel for the same distance. (I mean, don't drive faster than everyone else, not drive slower than everyone else, forcing people to have to wait for you. That will result in aggression and risky overtaking manoeuvres of other people, using more net fuel...) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Make your car aerodynamic**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Don't transport anything on the roof (if possible). The air resistance is very high. If you do, drive slowly. (See &quot;Drive slowly&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't accelerate too fast**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Give your cylinders a chance to use all the fuel you give to them efficiently. Accelerating too fast results in incomplete combustion and more fuel being used for nothing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And a few obvious ones (for sake of completeness)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Form alliances**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Take your neighbours to the shopping mall and they'll return the favour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Only drive when necessary**&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;You save the most fuel when you don't drive at all. Take the bus or train or hitch a ride with friends or neighbours." />

Also, PBDEs have been banned in the EU in 2004 and most types are also banned in the USA (see also [this article](http://toxipedia.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=296))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Wikipedia article on memory foam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_foam#Hazards) also mentions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; PBDEs are no longer used in most bedding foams, especially in the European Union.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it seems if your memory foam mattrass is not older than 8 or 9 years then it probably is PBDE free. If not chances are it contain PBDEs. If you want to be sure you should ask your supplier and/or manufacturer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that from a sustainability point of view it's better to buy mattrasses made from (organic) cotton, wool or natural latex since those are biodegradable." />

But according to my knowledge about  patterns promoted in the media and observations of my acquaintances, only a small part of it is the food that is actually spoiled. Most of that is thrown away because the *expiry date* is reached, someone has cooked too much or, most trivially, is bored with some food and doesn't want to finish it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My tips and recommendations are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Never buy too much. Learn how much you are able to eat and how much do you need to buy. Don't improvise in shop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Don't throw food away just because expiry date is reached. Note that the expiry date is made only to remove liability from producers and it's calculated for the most pessimistic scenario of keeping the product (too high temperature, exposition to light etc.). I've eaten a lot of products months, and in some cases (products in cans or jars) even years after the expiry date, and I never had problems because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Be disciplined. If you prepare something, eat it to the end. If you can't eat more, wait an hour. If you still can't eat more, store it in fridge. Never throw something away even if the potato cooked the previous day doesn't taste as good as one cooked right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4) In case of products that spoil very quickly in kitchen, such as fruits and vegetables, buy them regularly and in small portions that you can eat within 1 - (max) 3 days. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5) Dry bread can be powdered and used for chops or some other meal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6) Sweet fruits that are rotten but not moldy can be used to prepare a [hooch][1]. In worst case it can be used as fuel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7) Cheese or sausages that don't smell well, but don't stink, can be eaten if you fry them. In outdoor camps, if we find something that isn't looking very well after a few days in the rucksack, we fry that in campfire, without negative consequences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooch" />

Text="As [Highly Irregular suggests][1] this very much depends on the specifics of your vehicle, conditions outside of your car and your desired conditions inside your vehicle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When this question was brought up on [skeptics][2] the best evidence we could find was from Mythbusters which visited this topic in both [episode 22][3] and [episode 38][4]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Episide 22&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; PARTLY CONFIRMED *&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Tests were performed under varying conditions (55 mph versus 45 mph). The 55 mph test used a computer to estimate fuel efficiency based on air intake, not actual fuel consumption, and showed A/C was more efficient. The 45 mph test consisted of running the tank until it was empty, and showed open windows were more efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Because the original tests were inconclusive, this &quot;urban puzzle&quot; was revisited in episode 38: It is more fuel efficient to use air conditioning when the car is travelling approximately 50mph or more. Otherwise, windows are more fuel efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Episode 38&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; PARTLY CONFIRMED&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The fundamental flaw in the MythBusters’ test was that the point where the drag becomes powerful enough to inhibit a car’s performance with windows down was inside their 45 – 55mph margin at 50mph. Going less than 50mph it is more efficient to leave your windows down, but going greater than 50mph it is more efficient to use your A/C.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sadly unless you have the same vehicle, are driving in the same conditions and have the same comfort requirements, this tells you little about your own situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next time you fill up, decide on a strategy and stick to it until your next fill up, then calculate your overall fuel efficiency. Then try a different strategy and see if the efficiency changes. From a series of such tests you can build up a body of empirical evidence about how your own vehicle, preferences and environment interact, and thus find out what is most sustainable for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/736/164&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/5661/2772&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://mythbustersresults.com/episode22&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://mythbustersresults.com/episode38" />

The pumping of air is energy intensive&#xD;&#xA;* additional sludge: The aerobic digestion process creates sludge, consisting of non-digested matter and the aerobic bacteria. This has to be treated (de-watered, applied to land, evtl. burnt, ...) - actually a huge part of the costs of any WWTP is the sludge treatment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To get a rough figure, one would do this calculation (this needs some data from the wastes):  &#xD;&#xA;VS content of wastes X conversion factor VS to BOD X energy cost per BOD  &#xD;&#xA;Ash content of wastes X some factor for the sludge yield X energy cost per mass of sludge  &#xD;&#xA;This should account for most (energy costs). To fully understand the impact of the kitchen wastes one needs to know the downstream processes of the WWTP - for example, is the sludge burned, applied as fertilizer or used in some other way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note the following: If the WWTP has an anaerobic degistion before the aerobic stage, the kitchen wastes wil actually generate energy per methanization. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, landfills are at best just a postponement of the wastes for later generations.

Owners of turbines smaller than 100 kW were able to install three times the capacity removed and receive a bonus on top of the normal FiT for the first five years. For units of 100 kW-150 kW, owners could install twice the capacity removed and receive the same treatment. Under this programme 1480 turbines totalling 122 MW were replaced with 272 new turbines of 332 MW in sum. The second Danish repowering scheme ran from 2008-2011 and offered a premium on top of the normal tariff for replacing up to 175 MW of old turbines with new machines that had at least double the capacity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, one of the reasons for supporting repowering - better use of good wind sites - often did not apply. Owners of old wind farms could decommission their turbines and sell the resulting repowering certificates to other wind developers, who then applied the extra FiT to new projects elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “You just had to show you had decommissioned old turbines somewhere in Denmark,” says Sune Strøm, chief economist at the [Danish Wind Industry Association][2]. “There was no geographical link.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; According to Strøm, the system distorted the market value of old turbines and made the cost of compensating old investors artificially high. Today there are no specific incentives for repowering in Denmark.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/06/repowering-gives-new-life-to-old-wind-sites?cmpid=rss&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.windpower.org/en/" />

In most cases, this will go up the chimney - though I don't know your setup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This makes it hard to efficiently heat a home with fire - though pellet stoves (where a small fire is maintained automatically) or stoves with huge thermal mass (that evens out the heat output over time) are good ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your case, I would suggest conducting an experiment - assuming you can see and access your gas counter, you can monitor how much gas you use with and without using the stove to augment your heating, at the same time measureing (weighing) your wood consumption. One week with, one week without wood stove (given roughly the same weather and daily/weekly pattern of living) could give you some data to base your decision on." />

Make sure the rats cannot access any food or leftovers. This may be hard to do as rats can eat their way through various materials. Storing all food and garbage in metal containers will help. Also keep your place as clean as possible, so don't leave and food leftovers on the table and sweep or vacuum the floor regularly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Locate and seal all holes and entry points to your house to keep the rats out. You'll have to use very sturdy materials for this (metal or very thick wood). Rats are very good climbers so also check for holes at window frames and ceilings. Also check if there are no tree branches or bushes the rats can use to climb on your roof and access the house from there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Get a cat. The cat will catch some of the rats and hopefully drive away the remaining rats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Buy and place [rat traps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_trap). There are traps that kill a rat (snap traps), but also traps that just contain the rat (live traps) so you can release them several miles away from your home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Use an eco-friendly rat repellent. I've never tried those myself, but I've heard they may help (a little). Rats can't stand the smell of peppermint, so place peppermint plants around your house or soak some rags with peppermint oil. Rats also don't like moth balls and the smell of predators so dropping cat litter around your house if you have access to it may also help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you take the same measures as your neighbour the rats will hopefully have to go elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't use any poison because it's dangerous for children  and the smell of a decomposing rat somewhere in your wall or ceiling isn't pleasant. Also a poisoned rat may contaminate the enviroment if they die outside or poison cats and dogs if they find and eat the dead rat." />

He measures the average time it takes to do several common activities for which you'd typically need a light then measures the life span and energy usage of various types of bulbs under those conditions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;His conclusions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - CFLs cost more to manufacture and replace than they are worth in energy savings&#xD;&#xA; - Only turning a light on when you need it is still the best way to save money on lighting costs&#xD;&#xA; - Lighting is such a small percentage of the average electricity bill that you'd save a lot more electricity by buying a clothes line or replacing a water heater than by worrying about which type of light bulb to use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm inclined to agree with the majority of his conclusions but different usage patterns will have different results. I live in Florida where the primary electrical use is cooling during the summer months. Most of my lights have CFLs in them because they give off less heat (though I usually only use ambient sunlight during the day). Paul lives in Montana and considers the heat given off by incandescent bulbs a bonus during the long winters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until I read his article I can honestly say I didn't realize that CFLs were subsidized. (What isn't these days?) If something requires large subsidies to hide its true cost it's hard to call it sustainable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The IEEE has an article on [bulb lifespans][3] but doesn't give any concrete results.

Yes there are companies such as Seventh Generation but they are nowhere near the size nor do they hold the influence as say Georgia-Pacific or Kimberly-Clark.  &#xD;&#xA;If I could draw an analogy your question &amp; what happened pre-2008 in the state of CA with solar and the incentive program which home-owners and businesses were eager to take advantage of and at the same time lower their power bill. The companies that were benefiting were start-up companies because they were sleek &amp; nimble compared to PG&amp;E (Pacific Gas and Energy).  Not only that but it was free power and in many cases PG&amp;E were paying solar customers for the power they were generating as it was less expensive then they could get.  &#xD;&#xA;So, they lobbied the CA Public Utilities commission and lobbied Congress. If I'm not mistaken power was coming from Enron in the early to mid 2000's before that collapse. Not only was PG&amp;E powerful but they had allies with strong lobbying &amp; direct access. George W. does away with the solar incentives which was phased out finally in 08 (even before this it was drastically reduced and rules changed).  The booming solar business all but dried up. Near this time Germany took a commanding lead in the world market for sustainable energy.  &#xD;&#xA;Today solar is on the rebound but with many of the old players involved not the little startups 90% of which went belly up. (Who Killed the Electric Car? same scenario, they literally took every electric car off the streets and grinded up perfectly good cars into the size of egg shells). The pieces were not in place for the leaders in the energy sector (or automobile sector) as big industry moves slowly.  This is exactly why organic products are more expensive or detergents without chemical surfactants (which causes red tide). Any industry leader such as Weyerhauser is not going to sit idly bye and see their profits plummet.  The current economic structure of the capitalist economy puts zero value on natural resources (and by that I mean there is little reason to not exploit and ravage whatever they can).  &#xD;&#xA;However, there is good news. Thanks to authors like Paul Hawkens and William McDonough there is progress. There are a number of think tanks as well such as NEF, Happy Planet Index, Paecon and the Cambridge Trust for New Economic Thinking that are working together to create a new economic model that values nature. These positive points may not pertain to the question but I did not want to leave my answer sounding so pessimistic;-)&#xD;&#xA;  " />

Although you don't mention it, to make the answer complete, I add energy storage category (if you had a battery storage attached).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A PVE system can be in one of these states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Off** - no energy is produced. No insolation, or the system is stopped manually.&#xD;&#xA;2. **Idle** - panels are insolated but the DC power they produce is too low to output any AC power.&#xD;&#xA;3. **Active** - panels generate DC electricity and the inverter produces and supplies AC power.&#xD;&#xA;4. An **error state** - current break, under/overvoltage etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I. *Energy generation parameters*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Each string of panels has it's **DC voltage** and **DC amperage** in active state. Their product is current **DC power**. [MPPT][1] inverter always tries to gain the maximum power from panels. DC voltage is only monitored in idle state.&#xD;&#xA; 2. The most important performance parameter of the system is the inverter's **current AC power**. In case of a 3-phase inverter the total AC power can be split to more phases.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Because we generate electricity in time, the **total energy produced** in kWh is summing it up. We can aggregate through hours (hourly production), days (daily production), months, years etc. [Beautiful graphs][2] can be made from this (sorry for selfpromotion, but it's similar to the questioned system).&#xD;&#xA; 4. Current **AC power supplying to the grid** or total **energy supplied to the grid** throughout certain period of time are the final measurements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;II. *Supplemental parameters*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Temperature of panels**. The higher temperature the lower maximum produced energy and shorter panel life.&#xD;&#xA;2. **Temperature of inverter**. Inverters cool themselves down above certain temperature and consume (some) energy they produce.&#xD;&#xA;3. **Operating time** - sum of the time when inverter operated in active state. We try to maximize the energy produced during active time.&#xD;&#xA;4. Inverter should monitor **AC voltage** for under/overvoltage for safety purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;III. *Battery storage parameters*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Energy stored**. Can be in kWh or in % of total capacity.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Battery (bank) **voltage**.&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Time remaining to full charge**. Approximate value based on current rate of charging.&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Time remaining to discharge**. Approximate value based on current rate of discharging.&#xD;&#xA; 5. Number of **charge/discharge cycles**.&#xD;&#xA; 6. **Storage efficiency**, i.e. energy stored/energy released.&#xD;&#xA; 7. **Temperature** of battery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPPT&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.piko-solar-portal.de/PlantViewCharts.aspx?plantId=458a3872-8de8-4e85-a1d0-b4787b18d172" />

Compost is a key ingredient in organic farming. At the simplest level, the process of composting simply requires making a heap of wetted organic matter (leaves, &quot;green&quot; food waste) and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of weeks or months. Modern, methodical composting is a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture. Worms and fungi further break up the material. Aerobic bacteria manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium. The ammonium is further converted by bacteria into plant-nourishing nitrites and nitrates through the process of nitrification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For composting with worms see [tag:vermicomposting]" />

You need a media based bio filter similar to that of the towers but you wouldn't plant your plants in them.  The water flows through them allowing the bacteria to clean the water.  And immediately after the fish tanks you have some form of solids filter.  In many cases this comes in the form of a swirl filter where the water goes round and round allowing the big poops to fall to the bottom of the tank.

The flood and drain system described by Earthling is one, very popular, style of system.  It success is due to the fact that the grow bed where the plants are living is slowly filled, and then quickly drained.  This quick draining pulls oxygen into the bed.  This effectively is providing three things to the plant in a constant fashion:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. An unlimited supply of oxygen&#xD;&#xA; 2. Nutrients from the fish (more on how in a second)&#xD;&#xA; 3. An unlimited supply of water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The nutrients that the plants need come somewhat indirectly from the fish.  The fish go the bathroom.  This causes the ammonia levels to build up in the water.  There is a bacteria that will establish itself in the system which will convert this ammonia into nitrites.  Once the water starts to have a certain level of nitrites in it another bacteria will establish itself.  This second set of bacteria convert the nitrites into nitrates.

Nutrient rich water is trickled from one end of the tube to the other end in a constant flow - just enough water for the roots to drink from.  Plants sit in the holes every foot or so (depending on what you are growing) with their roots just touching the bottom of the tube.  This allows maximum fresh air to get to the roots as the water pulls it in as it travels.  The roots eventually grow into the tube and lay in the water.  Two immediate down sides to this technique is that 1) without appropriate filtering, solids can get stuck on the roots and eventually cake the root disallowing uptake of nutrients, water, and oxygen and 2) in hot and cold climates the water that enters the tube is at the temperature you specify but can be drastically different once it reaches the other end some 50-100' away.  This can cook the roots or freeze out the roots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DWC: Deep Water Culter - this is very much the same thing as NFT in principle but on a totally different scale.  Two big differences with this approach is that rather than planting in a small tube you plant in a huge trough of water.  The trough might be equally long 50-100' (or more) but the trough is also 4-5' wide and at least 12&quot; deep.  The water also enters one end and exits on the other end.  Another major difference is that the plants sit on a foam (usually) raft with holes cut in the raft.  The plants sit in plastic cups and almost their entire root body hands into the water totally submerged.  Filtering is still an issue but in aquaponics there are many that are running their water through a grow bed or grow tower prior to entering the DWC tank.  This way you don't loose the good stuff that is filtered.  And because of the sheer volume of water it doesn't tend to fluctuate in temperature nearly as much.  Also - having that much water means that keeping the chemical balance is usually easier.  One down side in some dwc systems is lack of oxygenation.  You can design bubbling spots in your plumbing and system but many people add additional pumps with bubble stones directly to the grow tank which aids in off gassing. " />

To be most useful to a general audience, *not just this question's asker*, I'll mention a couple rough methods:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The way you should track your energy choices in general is fairly simple:  monitor your energy bills monthly, **before and after** making the change (in this case, before and after installing the solar hot water system).  Energy utilities are often quite good at giving you detailed information on your bill.   While this method is rough, and fails when you make multiple changes at once (e.g. add a baby at the same time that you add solar hot water), it also has the benefit of encompassing all losses in the system, which you will not get if you only monitor *in situ* at the panels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. You could conduct a short experiment, and then extrapolate results to get your monthly, or yearly savings.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The experiment might involve switching off all other electric devices in the house (I recommend doing so at the circuit breakers, not by unplugging appliances individually).  &#xD;&#xA; - Leave your hot water system to operate normally.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - With a simple thermometer, take some cold water from your tap to measure its temperature.  Note the hot water setting at your house if you have a fixed *setpoint* (e.g. 60&amp;deg;C), or measure it again by drawing **hot** water from the tank's drain valve, or a nearby faucet.  Now you have your &amp;Delta;T (change in water temperature).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Start with the hot water at equilibrium (after the tank temperature is stable ... not right after a shower, or running the clothes washer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Record the initial electricity reading at your home's meter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Have your family take your normal daily showers.

The heat added by the solar system is approximately the total heat, minus the heat added by the electrical heater.

If you want to also run through a cycle with your clothes washer, or dish washer, then add them to the experiment.

To be most useful to a general audience, *not just this question's asker*, I'll mention a couple rough methods:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The way you should track your energy choices in general is fairly simple:  monitor your energy bills monthly, **before and after** making the change (in this case, before and after installing the solar hot water system).  Energy utilities are often quite good at giving you detailed information on your bill.   While this method is rough, and fails when you make multiple changes at once (e.g. add a baby at the same time that you add solar hot water), it also has the benefit of encompassing all losses in the system, which you will not get if you only monitor *in situ* at the panels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. You could conduct a short experiment, and then extrapolate results to get your monthly, or yearly savings.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The experiment might involve switching off all other electric devices in the house (I recommend doing so at the circuit breakers, not by unplugging appliances individually).  &#xD;&#xA; - Leave your hot water system to operate normally.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - With a simple thermometer, take some cold water from your tap to measure its temperature.  Note the hot water setting at your house if you have a fixed *setpoint* (e.g. 60&amp;deg;C), or measure it again by drawing **hot** water from the tank's drain valve, or a nearby faucet.  Now you have your &amp;Delta;T (change in water temperature).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Start with the hot water at equilibrium (after the tank temperature is stable ... not right after a shower, or running the clothes washer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Record the initial electricity reading at your home's meter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Have your family take your normal daily showers.  Note the exact length of the showers, in seconds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Wait a few hours, or until you're sure that water tank temperature has recovered to the steady state value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You'll need to know the flow rate of your shower.

The heat added by the solar system is approximately the total heat, minus the heat added by the electrical heater.

I'm guessing you have a cold rinse, which you wouldn't want to measure for this test.  Cycles that mix hot and cold might be harder to measure ... I'll have to get back to you on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - For the dish washer, you might just have to search for manufacturer's data on your model, to see how much hot water per cycle it uses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Extrapolating&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you just perform this experiment once, it's obviously dependent on how sunny that day was.

To find the answer one must look at the bigger picture for it has to do with a number of contributing factors much larger than the bleaching of a piece of paper.   &#xD;&#xA;The outdated economical model currently used today combined with the corporate power in politics (some would argue increasingly fascist over capitalist) plays a large part.  In the case of paper products these corporations are Weyerhauser, Georgia Pacific and Kimberly Clark among others.  This is one of the sectors that peaked in the early stage of the industrial revolution/era with the advent of high tech mills, new machines that could increase production.  Its infrastructure had been built over the century and continues to be maintained.  In the last half of the century their profit margins have fallen considerably due to factors such as reduced viable resources and the public awareness due to investigative journalism (early on black and white pictures of clear cut ancient old growth forest to more recent books like Silent Spring by Rachel Carsons).  &#xD;&#xA;Capitalism (which some liken to a trusty old tractor that we have much to thank for it; yet at the same time is a rusting decrepit machine, rapidly slowing down and on its way to a creeping halt) and its survival of the fittest theory puts profit over all else including the welfare of the ecosystem and natural resources.  I believe we are all aware of the powerful lobbyists in Congress. This system allows largest of corporations (especially in the oldest of sectors i.e. logging, farming, fossil fuels, mining) to receive tax incentives/breaks and have laws (pork barrel spending) written in their best interest.  Their sectors are even subsidized through “tough times” with no end in sight.  &#xD;&#xA;**What does this big picture stuff have to do with unbleached toilet paper you ask?**  Nearly everything.  I have just laid out a summary of how things have been.  The “power brokers” of the logging pulp and paper industry such as Kimberly-Clark have seen their enormous profits dive, have no incentive to change and lobby to stay atop their sector.  Their business model is much more difficult, time consuming and costly to change as this model is not of the information age rather the early industrial age.  On top of that you have large industrial chemical complex that doesn’t want to lose business that will be replaced with nothing.  These corporations have to answer to the board members and stockholders about projected quarterly earnings.&#xD;&#xA;*BTW this is an edit as my first answer attempted to draw an analogy to the start of solar power.  Its success was rapid but mainly for consumers and companies small enough to adapt quickly. Once it was realized the largest, most powerful were ill equipped to handle change so quickly all of the incentives quickly went away.*   &#xD;&#xA;Yes, there are several retail companies such as Seventh Generation and other reputable companies offer unbleached tissue but the price is expensive compared to bleached toilet paper (which is not logical unless you take into consideration the above) .  Seventh Generation is the #1 rated company on the planet based on their overall social and environmental records.  This rating is achieved by a 5 step process which starts with over 20 years worth of data collected from a wide range of public, private and nonprofit sources. To be ethical costs money in a capitalist free-market economy that does not value natural resources and workers rights (hours, wage, age, etc.). This can be applied to many things that seem illogical like organic food.  &#xD;&#xA;But wait, all is not bleak.  There is good news. Thanks to authors like Paul Hawkens and William McDonough there is progress. There are a number of think tanks around the world such as NEF, Happy Planet Index, Paecon and the Cambridge Trust for New Economic Thinking that are working together to create a new economic model that values nature.  There are also more immediate action views like [Kick It Over][1] Although, these positive points may not pertain to the question, I did not want to leave my answer sounding so pessimistic ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://kickitover.org" />

An EV traction motor may very well last 1,000,000 miles, versus perhaps one quarter of that for most ICEs.  While it's true that current EVs tend to use batteries to power the motors, and batteries may need to be replaced at a comparable interval to an ICE timing belt, an EV with a new battery is going to run much more like a new vehicle than an ICE with a new timing belt.  The regenerative braking associated with the electric motor will also prolong brake life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Electric motors are more quiet than ICEs.**  This is a controversial topic.  I believe noise pollution to be a problem, and thus, a quieter car to be better (especially with respect to *sustainability*).  Some are concerned about pedestrian safety with quieter electric motors.  While this problem can be, and is being, addressed by adding noise makers to electric cars, I believe this solution is actually misguided.  The basis for this aversion to quiet cars partly draws from a [multi-year study][1] in the US concerning pedestrian accidents with hybrid vehicles.  The hybrid vehicles had a 40% higher rate of pedestrian accidents than non-hybrids.  However, the study did not correct for the fact that in the US, hybrids tend to be owned by city-dwellers, and the rate of pedestrian accidents is twice as high in cities vs. rural areas, for all cars.  I believe this factor alone can explain the 40% result.  Also, during this study, which involved thousands of hybrid cars, not a single blind person was killed by a quiet hybrid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Size matters**.  In an application-agnostic answer, it's important to note that for some applications, electric motors are more versatile because of the variety of sizes they come in.  Hopefully, it's obvious that an ICE to make your phone vibrate is not an option, but a motor works quite well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Disadvantages of Electric Motors&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without specifying your application, I'll try to discuss multiple transportation applications.  For cars or trains, the excess **weight** of a battery pack that drives an electric motor is not a huge penalty.  The road provides extra normal force to balance the vehicle weight.  However, in aerospace applications, power-to-weight ratio is more critical.  So, for airplanes, using electric motors for propulsion is still not practical.  Liquid fuels have a [higher energy density][4] compared to batteries, which makes petro-fuels or biofuels more attractive for airborne propulsion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is less of a problem for cars, which [do not yet have to levitate][5].  Also, it should be noted that comparisons of energy density for liquid fuels vs. batteries distort the true picture, because **total weight** is what's important, and an ICE system requires a heavy ICE, and a heavy transmission.  When the whole system is considered, battery EVs suffer a noticeable, but acceptable, weight penalty for their lower energy-density fuel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Battery range** (capacity) is also a problem for EVs.  However, I believe this issue to be exaggerated, as the average US driver (who drives a lot!) still only drives 40 miles on an average day.  In the future, more charging stations will also minimize the range problem for electric cars.  However, for now, range versatility has to be considered an advantage of ICE vehicles.  An interesting compromise is made by Chevy's [Volt EV][3], which is fundamentally an electric car, but which carries an on board generator for recharging with liquid petro-fuel.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**Temperature** constraints can be a disadvantage for electric motors, *due to the batteries themselves*.  High temperatures can shorten battery life, and very low temperatures can (temporarily) reduce the useful capacity of the battery.  Note that normal temperatures here on earth are well-suited to battery EVs, so this issue is more a problem if your area has temperature extremes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Economic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is difficult to answer without a more specific question.  Electric motors will draw their fuel from different sources than internal combustion engines.  Each country will have different economics regarding their electric grid, and oil consumption.

An EV traction motor may very well last 1,000,000 miles, versus perhaps one quarter of that for most ICEs.  While it's true that current EVs tend to use batteries to power the motors, and batteries may need to be replaced at a comparable interval to an ICE timing belt, an EV with a new battery is going to run much more like a new vehicle than an ICE with a new timing belt.  The regenerative braking associated with the electric motor will also prolong brake life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Electric motors are more quiet than ICEs.**  This is a controversial topic.  I believe noise pollution to be a problem, and thus, a quieter car to be better (especially with respect to *sustainability*).  Some are concerned about pedestrian safety with quieter electric motors.  While this can be, and is being, addressed by adding noise makers to electric cars, I believe this solution is actually misguided.  The basis for this aversion to quiet cars partly draws from a [multi-year study][1] in the US concerning pedestrian accidents with hybrid vehicles.  The hybrid vehicles had a 40% higher rate of pedestrian accidents than non-hybrids.  However, the study did not correct for the fact that in the US, hybrids tend to be owned by city-dwellers, and the rate of pedestrian accidents is twice as high in cities vs. rural areas, for all cars.  I believe this factor alone can explain the 40% result.  Also, during this study, which involved thousands of hybrid cars, not a single blind person was killed by a quiet hybrid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Size matters**.  In an application-agnostic answer, it's important to note that for some applications, electric motors are more versatile because of the variety of sizes they come in.  Hopefully, it's obvious that an ICE to make your phone vibrate is not an option, but a motor works quite well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Disadvantages of Electric Motors&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Without specifying your application, I'll try to discuss multiple transportation applications.  For cars or trains, the excess **weight** of a battery pack that drives an electric motor is not a huge penalty.  The road provides extra normal force to balance the vehicle weight.  However, in aerospace applications, power-to-weight ratio is more critical.  So, for airplanes, using electric motors for propulsion is still not practical.  Liquid fuels have a [higher energy density][4] compared to batteries, which makes petro-fuels or biofuels more attractive for airborne propulsion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is less of a problem for cars, which [do not yet have to levitate][5].  Also, it should be noted that comparisons of energy density for liquid fuels vs. batteries distort the true picture, because **total weight** is what's important, and an ICE system requires a heavy ICE, and a heavy transmission.  When the whole system is considered, battery EVs suffer a noticeable, but acceptable, weight penalty for their lower energy-density fuel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Battery range** (capacity) is also a problem for EVs.  However, I believe this issue to be exaggerated, as the average US driver (who drives a lot!) still only drives 40 miles on an average day.  In the future, more charging stations will also minimize the range problem for electric cars.  However, for now, range versatility has to be considered an advantage of ICE vehicles.  An interesting compromise is made by Chevy's [Volt EV][3], which is fundamentally an electric car, but which carries an on-board generator for recharging the battery by burning liquid petro-fuel.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**Temperature** constraints can be a disadvantage for electric motors, *due to the batteries themselves*.  High temperatures can shorten battery life, and very low temperatures can (temporarily) reduce the useful capacity of the battery.  Note that *normal* temperatures here on earth are well-suited to battery EVs, so this issue is more a problem if your area has temperature extremes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Economic&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is difficult to answer without a more specific question.  Electric motors will draw their fuel from different sources than internal combustion engines.  Each country will have different economics regarding their electric grid, and oil consumption.  If your country has more abundant resources to produce electricity (coal, natural gas, solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear), you may consider electric motors an economic benefit.  If you're in an oil country, maybe not.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you add biofuels to the mix, you add agriculture as a factor.  Most internal combustion engines can use varying levels of biofuels.  An [Otto cycle engine needs modest engine modifications to run rich ethanol blends][2].

Text="From the general principles outlined in *Sustainable Energy--without the hot air* by David J.C. MacKay (http://www.withouthotair.com/c20/page_118.shtml):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. In short-distance travel with lots of starting and stopping, the energy&#xD;&#xA;mainly goes into speeding up the vehicle and its contents. Key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to&#xD;&#xA;weigh less, and to go further between stops. Regenerative braking,&#xD;&#xA;which captures energy when slowing down, may help too. In addition, it&#xD;&#xA;helps to move slower, and to move less.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. In long-distance travel at steady speed, by train or automobile, most&#xD;&#xA;of the energy goes into making air swirl around, because you only&#xD;&#xA;have to accelerate the vehicle once. The key strategies for consuming&#xD;&#xA;less in this sort of transportation are therefore to move slower, and to&#xD;&#xA;move less, and to use long, thin vehicles.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. In all forms of travel, there’s an energy-conversion chain, which takes&#xD;&#xA;energy in some sort of fuel and uses some of it to push the vehicle forwards. Inevitably this energy chain has inefficiencies. In a standard fossil-fuel car, for example, only 25% is used for pushing, and&#xD;&#xA;roughly 75% of the energy is lost in making the engine and radiator&#xD;&#xA;hot. So a final strategy for consuming less energy is to make the&#xD;&#xA;energy-conversion chain more efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; These observations lead us to six principles of vehicle design and vehicle use for more-efficient surface transport:&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a) reduce the frontal area per person; &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; b) reduce the vehicle’s weight per person; &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; c) when traveling, go at a steady speed and avoid using brakes; &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; d) travel more slowly; &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; e) travel less;&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; f) make the energy chain more efficient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We’ll now discuss a variety of ways to apply these principles.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems that a pickup truck operating on railroad tracks would get a benefit from traveling at a steady speed for longer distances, but would still be at a disadvantage compared to trains in that: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. It is not long and thin (does not pull more people or freight in its wake, after it has already done the work of moving the air in front of it). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Its drive train (internal combustion engine) is not efficient as a train's electric drive (powered by a diesel generator, but still more efficient).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also an advantage of using railroad wheels on rails instead of rubber on concrete. According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance, the railroad wheels have a coefficient of rolling resistance of 0.0010 to 0.0024; while car tires on concrete get 0.010 to 0.015. The resistive force is proportional to this coefficient, and various websites list rolling resistance as about 5% of the energy loss in on-road vehicles, so by my calculations, this aspect of running a truck on rails rather than on the road might save you 4-5%." />

How were people living before?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are quite different living patterns in big cities and in small cities or villages. When I first came to a big city and I was living with other people, I was shocked how much water was used! The average usage of 6 cubic meters per person per month is almost 10 times more than by my family.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, you don't have to take a shower or bath! You can wash yourself in a basin. The average water usage will be between 5 and 10 liters. While on camp, where water has to be taken from a very small spring, I've managed to wash myself completely in about 2 liters of water, using a bottle. The basin water you can use to flush the toilet 1 or 2 times. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You don't always have to flush with a full tank. You can use a small pot, about 1-2 liters. This would in most cases be sufficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Being more social is being more energy efficient. If everyone sits in their own room with lights and TV on, the energy consumption is high. When people are sitting together in one room, talking or playing board games, the energy consumption is much lower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the biggest energy consumers is transport. Eat mostly the things that grow in your environment. Buy potatoes from your neighbor instead of rice from Thailand, eat apples instead of bananas (example from Europe, you can modify it to fit your specific locale).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Buy warm clothes. Don't make your apartment too warm in winter. Years ago it was obvious that you have to wear a warm sweater in winter in your apartment, now people seem to be unhappy they can't be naked all the year." />

Remove the top layer of the soil, because gnats generally lay their eggs on the top layer. Take the plants outside, use a shovel and remove about one inch of the soil's top layer. If necessary, place new soil in the pot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First try removing any food sources they have been feeding from. This would include removing any fruit left out on counters. Any houseplants should be ideally planted in containers that can drain since gnats also love wet, standing water on top of soil. Your plant’s soil should be moist but not overwatered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some gnats can develop due to excessive moisture so be careful not to over-water the plants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I read some articles on the internet from which I got some nice solutions that fit here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Gnatrol**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a product on the market called Gnatrol. It's a natural bacillus toxin that can be added to the water when you water your plants. Gnatrol will kill the larvae, but the plants have to be treated several times, about six weeks total. This is a very effective method as long as you are not also fertilizing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Moth balls**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moth balls are another way to get rid of gnats. Place one to two moth balls in a 12-inch pot and it should get rid of the gnats.

The panel can easily reach 100°C if the pump stops and the pressure will rise. An expansion tank is a must and water is not &lt;strike&gt;to go&lt;/strike&gt; usable because it would boil out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Edit**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another possibility would be a [bubble pump system or Geyser Pump][2].

You can just pick your favorite insulation and make sure the walls are designed to use it effectively. From a heating standpoint, it doesn't really matter if you use fiberglass, foam, insulated concrete forms, or blown-in cellulose as long as the wall assemblies have the R-value your looking for and everything is built and installed correctly. In a cold climate, reducing heating fuel consumption will have a far greater impact over the useful life of the insulation than choosing &quot;green&quot; materials. That said, some materials are clearly more sustainable than others. Refer to [Zach's answer](http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/897/462) for more information on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're buying an existing but under-insulated home you might want blown-in cellulose because it can be installed in uninsulated cavities without tearing apart the wall. It's also very simple to add a layer in the attic. If/when you need to replace the siding, you might want to install foam boards between the wall and the new siding. Foam boards are also a good option for masonry or concrete walls. Wood-framed structures will probably give you more options for adding insulation than masonry or concrete walls will because wood-framed walls have cavities that can be filled with just about any type of insulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also keep in mind that insulation only prevents heat transfer through itself. Studs between insulated cavities will conduct heat better than you'd like no matter what. Ideally, your home will have a continuous &quot;shell&quot; of insulation that is broken only by windows, doors, plumbing penetrations, and exhaust outlets/air intakes. That said, some insulation is better than none, and at some point the cost just isn't worth it unless you have a whole lot of money to throw around." />

By cloth, I mean we printed t shirts and used scrap t shirts to make the filters - just wrap 3-4 layers of t shirts around a screen printing screen and that's the filter (6-8 layers of cloth, one layer of ~0.5mm mesh). We had effectively a split tank with the filter at the top of the separating barrier, so water flowed through the filter into the &quot;clean&quot; side. It definitely was never drinkable, the hydrocarbons from the inks stayed in the water and made it smell bad forever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found the settling tank did 90% of the work, what was left was very fine ink particles and some floating debris. The cloth filter got that out very effectively, and we changed that when it was obviously holding the water back - the level on the &quot;clean&quot; side was much lower than on the dirty side. Or when we had a pile of discarded t shirts. I'd just roughly cut the sleeves and printed front off, then use the clean back sections on the filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our system was smaller than yours, our tank was only about 300 litres. But if you already have a 2 cubic metre tank and can get another one I suggest trying a setup like the one we used. Put the &quot;clean&quot; tank a little lower than the existing dirty one, have the overflow from the dirty tank run over/through the filter, and see how it goes. If you're using cloth I suggest a frame with cloth resting on wire mesh, so it's easy to see how clean the cloth is and change it when required. Make sure the overflow from that filter is able to take the full flow out of the dirty tank, because the filter will get blocked at some point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the settling/dirty tank got too full of &quot;gunk&quot; that had settled out we would drain most of the water out using a syphon, then when the siphon was sucking up dirty water we'd stop it and dispose of the rest. We usually let that build up until it was about half full - so there was only ~20cm of water on top of 20cm of sediment." />

The paper gets chopped up into pulp. Air is introduced and the ink sticks to the air bubbles, which rise to the top. The ink bubbles are then skimmed of the top and the fibres are processed into recycled paper (newspaper, for example). This might be a nice little project, but I doubt anyone has the stamina to make recycled paper at home. The outcome will be pretty, but certainly not printable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In principle, paper can be composted as well, but the fibres are usually bleached, which already introduces some chemicals into the paper. Most inks also contain harmful chemicals, so composting might not be the best idea. In a sense, composting paper could also be seen to be a waste. It takes a lot to get trees into paper form. Ending the life-cycle of the fibres by composting reduces the availability of recycled paper, and is at least partly responsible for chopping down more trees. (On a side note, greasy paper, like pizza boxes, should be composted, because oil is very hard to remove in the recycling process.)" />

I will look at comments sorry have been away from board trying to find employment!" Text="As the question has inferred, it is logical that by not using bleach in paper products (in this case the household consumer type) it would cut cost and also save the toxins from the environment. To find the answer one must look at the bigger picture for it has to do with a number of contributing factors much larger than the bleaching of a piece of paper.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of these contributing factors is the fact that our current economic model puts zero value in nature or ecosystems.  It is based on a business mentality of survival of the fittest with “survival” meaning those that can make money in the economic conditions.  There is no benefit in conservation in a model that has no way of equating such with cost, profit, ROI, etc.&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;Another contributing factor is that the corporations had been given an exorbitant amount of power back in the late 1800’s.  Since this time, corporate power has increasingly gained traction in the political arena through (among other things) the power of lobbying, the landmark decision that  a corporation is a person and the filling out of the Cabinet by corporate VPs, CEOs, Board Members etc.  This ensures that the corporations’ best interests are looked out for when drafting and revising new bills. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of the controlling powers in the tissue industry (wood pulp) are long-standing corporations that first made their mark in logging old growth forests such as Weyerhauser, GP and Kimberly Clark.  They like all corporations that profit off the exploitative harvesting of a natural resource that is exhaustible go through a boom and bust cycle.  When they run out of the natural resource their profit margins go down.  However, they maintain a high degree of power and influence in the political arena.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet another factor is that the pulp and paper business is what one may consider an old sector of the economy such as the railroads, mining, etc.  In such large corporations that began so long ago they are adverse to change and when they do it is much slower in comparison to say, nanotechnology.  They do not adapt well like the new sectors because their infrastructure has basically stayed the same for more than a century.  In contrast computers, chips, etc. have been made to adapt because their marketplace changes virtually overnight.       &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What does this big picture stuff have to do with unbleached toilet paper you ask?**&#xD;&#xA;Nearly everything. I have just laid out a number of factors and to summarize: The “power brokers” of the logging pulp and paper industry have no incentive to change. Their business model is adverse to change. The early industrial age business model was not designed like that of today's information age companies. Not previously mentioned there is also a large, powerful industrial chemical complex that doesn’t want to lose business that will be replaced with nothing. These corporations have to answer to the board members and stockholders about projected quarterly earnings. (However, we as consumers have the power to change this through our buying habits). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, there are several retail companies such as Seventh Generation and other reputable companies offer unbleached tissue but the price is expensive compared to bleached toilet paper (which is illogical unless you take into consideration the above and the next statements) .  [Seventh Generation is the #1 rated company on the planet][1] based on their overall social and environmental records.  This rating is achieved by a [5 step process which starts with over 20 years worth of data collected][2] from [a wide range of public, private and nonprofit sources.][3] To be ethical costs money in a capitalist free-market economy that does not value natural resources and workers rights (hours, wage, age, etc.). This can be applied to many things that seem illogical like organic food.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is good news. Thanks to authors like Paul Hawkens and William McDonough there is progress. There are a number of think tanks around the world such as [NEF][4], [Happy Planet Index][5], [Paecon][6] and the Cambridge Trust for New Economic Thinking that are working together to create a new economic model that values nature.  There are also more immediate action views like [Kick It Over][7] Although, these positive points may not pertain to the question, I did not want to leave my answer sounding so pessimistic ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.betterworldshopper.com/topten.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.betterworldshopper.com/rankings.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.betterworldshopper.org/research.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.neweconomics.org/our-work/entry/environment&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.happyplanetindex.org/data/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://kickitover.org" />

If necessary, place new soil in the pot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First try removing any food sources they have been feeding from. This would include removing any fruit left out on counters.

While the list provided by Linger is good in just about any case, they generally only save minor amounts of energy.  If you are in a location that supports it, I would just turn off all heating and cooling.  For example, I used to live in an apartment in Boulder, CO with south facing windows that didn't even have AC, and we never turned the heat on, even when the temperature fell well below freezing.  This was possible because we opened and closed the shades correctly to take advantage of the Southern exposure, and kept the windos open at night during the Summer to try to &quot;night flush&quot; the air.  But this is only applicable to moderate climates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For very hot and dry climates, getting a smaller portable swamp cooler will save lots of energy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hot wet climates are a little unfortunate however (probably a reason humans haven't really developed in these places, since sweating, the same mechanism swamp coolers use, is ineffective).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In really cold climates, the best option is to attempt to take advantage of sunlight when it is out, and when it is not, close all the windows as much as possible with insulating (or just thick cloth) shades.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One interesting way to test your potential for passive heating and cooling is to turn off all heating and cooling for a period of time, say a week or two (unless it gets below freezing often, then have the heating on just enough so you don't freeze pipes...) and try to figure out what works best for your apartment at your location as far as operating shades and windows, and wearing heavier clothes and blankets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a side note, you mentioned that you cannot install a programmable thermostat, but in many apartments that have older, simpler thermostats, the wires are actually all there to replace it with a programmable one, so you may want to check.

I think rain barrels are great water saving devices, and can provide *some* buffer against run-off.  They're also cheap and easy to install, and can often repurpose existing containers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I would still answer **&quot;No, they should not be considered substitutes for rain gardens in building codes&quot;**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Why&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, we need to understand what the purpose of a building code is.  It's not a way to create the **best** possible residential units.  It's a means to provide sort of a *lowest-common-denominator* solution.  A *minimum* acceptable standard for something - in this case, stormwater management.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Someone such as yourself, who's in tune with these issues, an active gardener, and motivated to consider sustainability, might very well be able to improve upon the building code's solutions.  But, the code isn't so much for **you**, as it is for those who don't care about this stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For rain barrels to perform a stormwater management function, requires some active management on your part.  As [Highly Irregular said][1], you have to watch the fill level of your barrels constantly.  Most residents won't do this reliably.   A 55 gallon rain barrel can fill up fast, so it's easy to envision that in a short time, it might have *zero* benefit for stormwater management.  If the barrel is full, and has to drain via the overflow tube, you get absolutely no drainage benefit.  The rain garden is much more work to setup, but in my opinion, once it's working, it should continue to function with less intervention, compared to the rain barrel.  If the right native species are planted, once established, you should only have to make sure somebody doesn't completely mow over the garden.  Any other maintenance should be few and far between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, building codes primarily serve to govern plans for **new** buildings.  When you have an empty lot that's yet to be landscaped, it's less work to install a good rain garden.  After the home/building and yard are complete, and you want to add *additional* water management, I think rain barrels offer a reasonable retrofit solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Parallels&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me, this also reminds me of *geoengineering* solutions, which I generally tend to be opposed to.  For example, a proposal to combat global warming by injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere.  True, this would block sunlight, which would have a cooling effect.  But, sun is a good thing.  Blocking it would have other detrimental effects, and this &quot;*solution*&quot; does nothing to fight the non-warming problems associated with increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels (e.g. ocean acidification).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actively managed rain barrels might serve the purpose of stormwater management, but a plastic barrel isn't a plant.  Rain gardens are also good because they involve planting native species, keeping greenspace green instead of turning it into concrete, patio or deck area, and they also promote good biodiversity.  Rain barrels by themselves don't do these things.  The only thing they're assured of doing is saving some water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Saving water is good.  I use rain barrels, and especially recommend them for retrofits, where the yard is already planted (with or without rain garden).  I just don't think they're a *substitute* for rain gardens in building codes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/1130/486" />

But I have a problem organising them and I am yet to find a way to store them efficiently.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I mean by effective? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I want constant insertion time. For example, [container like this one][1] has this property - all you need is to squeeze bag in it. Simple folding a bag is also perfectly ok with me.&#xD;&#xA; - I want random access to my bags. That's because there are quite a lot of different types of bags (tiny to large, easy to break to strong ones, etc.) and I want to get a bag I want easily and fast. The container from previous point does not have this property. If I want to get a bag from the middle or the bottom of it, I need to take out all bags above the one I want. That's just irritating and it's the drawback of the vast majority of bag containers.&#xD;&#xA; - I want to have all bags visible - that's similar to previous one, I want to see all the bags, so I can quickly spot and then take the one I want.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I thought of using a few containers, each one for different type of a bag, but after some time I discarded this idea - there are too many types and I would need to have ~10 containers in order to compensate for their drawbacks mentioned above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hadn't yet tried it, but I found an [interesting video][2] which shows a flag-like folding method.

The two are not the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One reason is kind of a corollary to an argument that's common [in economics][1].  The argument is that an economy works better when each of us specialize in what we're good at, and leave the other work for people with different talents.  If you're really great at growing tomatoes, I suggest you take up tomato farming.  If you're better at something else, do that for a living.  In economics, you do have different priorities (vs. sustainability).  However, they're not completely unrelated.  Economic efficiency focuses on costs.  Sustainability focuses on energy, pollution and finite resources.  But energy and resources cost money, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The organic tomato farmer is *also* trying to run a successful business.  They don't want to use more energy, water, organic fertilizer, or land than they need to.  They'll try to minimize those things, and given their experience, will likely do a better job than you do.  Economies of scale matter.  It's hard to have economies of scale in a backyard garden.  Do it if you love to garden, or want the freshest possible food.  But, don't assume it's most sustainable.  You should plant the kind of plants in your yard that are native to your area, or provide habitat for birds, insects or animals we **do** need more of.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here's also a link about the relative importance of &quot;food miles&quot;][2] in the energy equation, which I think tends to be overrated.  For example, if transportation to market represents only 4% of greenhouse gas emissions for a certain food, are you sure your home farming won't be more than 4% less efficient than the professional farmer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Misconceptions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There also appear to be a few assumptions in the question that I'd challenge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Using a cat or dog *would* be sustainable** (if not for allergies, or lazy cat syndrome).  If a dog or cat is active enough to be any good at chasing squirrels (and probably only when they're young), then they'll need a high-energy diet.  Such a pet, pound-for-pound, is going to consume much more food energy than a human.  Food takes energy, land, water, and soil to grow.  Pets can have a [large negative environmental impact][3], even though they're &quot;natural&quot;.  Keeping one just to protect your tomatoes would be like buying a schoolbus to drive to the grocery store, but claiming it's sustainable because it's a hybrid. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Shooting squirrels would *not* be sustainable**.  I vehemently defend species under threat from human activity, but not all animals fall into this category.  Mankind has generally chased away the squirrel's natural predators, so in many areas people live, squirrel populations have increased.  Thus, killing squirrels isn't necessarily unsustainable (especially if you, or local birds, eat them).  Yes, squirrels do help propagate trees, but where you live, there's a good chance that humans decide which trees get planted, and which are removed.  If humans perform this function, we can probably tolerate a reduction in the number of squirrels doing so as well.  [For balance, I'll link to PETA's defense of squirrels][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Growing your own peppers would be better**.  This is really just about the *specialization* argument again, and how doing everything yourself isn't the point of sustainability, and usually isn't efficient.  The relative sustainability gains you might achieve in growing your own peppers are likely small compared to the losses of growing crops that are eaten by overpopulated rodents.  Worry about the tomato problem first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##If you really need a narrow answer to this question ...&#xD;&#xA;You might need to provide more information.  **Why** are tomato cages not practical for you?  We may need to understand this is in order to give you another recommendation.  Cages would have been my suggestion, and in general, I think the MNN article covers most good alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/divisionoflaborspecialization.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://psufoodscience.typepad.com/psu_food_science/files/es702969f.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://phys.org/news176582720.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.peta.org/issues/wildlife/squirrels.aspx" />

So there are round trips which would involve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, but which could be sustainable. Obviously the round trip would be a net consumer of energy, but the price of energy differs by time, place and form, so this can still be economically viable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, one way to look at the relationship between pollution and sustainability is this:  &#xD;&#xA;**if there are procedures in place to reverse the pollution; and / or if the rate of release of pollutants is less than the sink rate of the environment, and if the pollutants' pathways from source to sink does not cause collateral harm on the way, then it could be sustainable. Otherwise, it is unsustainable.**" />

Therefore I will focus my answer on the latter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most low-maintance, low resources solution probably is to build a green roof covered with sedumplants. Sedum can survive under many circumstances. In warm climates you may need to water the plants occasionally, but this is not necessary in moderate climates. The only maintance required is to check your water drains once or twice a year and unclog them if needed. You might want to take out the weeds once every year, but this is not strictly necessary. Basic instructions on how to build a sedum-covered roof can be found [here](http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/94/99). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of sedum you can grow herbs and/or grasses on your roof, but these require a sturdier roof, more maintenance, more water and possibly also some fertilizer (depending on the types of plants). It's even possible to grow bushes and trees on your roof, but you'll need an even stronger roof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Requirements:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - All vegetation-covered roofs&#xD;&#xA;   - a good waterproof and root resistant layer, preferably not older than 10 years.&#xD;&#xA;   - good drainage&#xD;&#xA;   - slope preferably less than 15 degrees.

The very low (nonexistent) throughput could be because I am experimenting on a small tank -&gt; not much pressure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See schematic above, its a classic gravity filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Pump-assisted Sand Filter #&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I made three different designs of filters, with gravity, pump and pressurized. I would like to get your advices about it. Even if its not drawn, all the pump have valves in order to regulate the throughput.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem of the filter below is that the pump has to stop sometimes to prevent overflow... Is is a slow solution. But once again, I will run the filter only few times every 6 months. So why not.&#xD;&#xA;![Using gravity for the throughput][2] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Using pump for the throughput][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the filter below, since its pressurized, maybe the sand level should be higher ?&#xD;&#xA;![Tank is closed and therefore pressurized][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for your help, **I will keep you up to date**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ESQou.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qABNE.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/IYidF.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/9AEMw.png" />

Washing with cold water (as in the delicate mode) is by far the easiest step you can take toward sustainable clothes-washing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm no expert on clothes, but I do wear and wash them and I've found that washing with cold water works fine even for sweaty athletic clothes or slightly dirty hiking clothes. The delicate cycle on most washing machines uses cold water, and it will clean anything you wear around town, to the gym, or to work (unless you wear suits or work with oily and greasy stuff). You can usually get very muddy clothes down to an acceptable level of dirt by allowing the mud to dry and shaking it off or by doing a quick pre-wash by hand in a sink or bathtub. Also, cold water doesn't make dyes bleed the way hot water does, so you can usually mix dark and light-colored clothes. Combining loads when possible is an easy way to be more sustainable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yes, it is more sustainable to wash on the delicate cycle and your clothes will still be clean when the machine finishes." />

As an example, let’s look at Idaho — state in north-western US in the Rocky mountain region.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In 2008 the [Raft River project][1] began providing power commercially. It was one of the first GT power-generating plants in the Pacific North-West, according to PBS documentary. Built by private company, utilizing the former geothermal site of US Department of Energy (in the early 80s there was built and run 7MW demonstration project, allegedly first commercial-sized binary liquid GT power plant), it produces 13 MW, and is accessing surveyed water source that is theoretically capable of giving out 110 MW of energy. To access the water at the temperatures of 135 to 148 °C they only need to drill 1300 to 1800 m (4500 to 6000 feet) — which is a lot less drilling than HDR geothermal would require to achieve the same temperature difference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Idaho Department of Water Resources provides [overview of geothermal][2] in the state, including definitions (sources of 30 to 100 °C are classified as low temperature geothermal (LTG), and those over 100 °C — as high temperature geothermal (HTG)), and the link to the map of geothermal resources. Map shows quite a few sources surveyed, including a decent number of those with temperatures of over 50 °C, and while the use of those resources is increasing (downtown Boise and recently connected Boise State University campus have many buildings already heated by geothermal systems), there are still many of them untapped, and most of them require a lot less work than HDR geothermal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, it is understandable that specific geological situation on the border of tectonic plates provides for abundance of sources, and those areas deep inside plate boundaries may not have these resources so easily accessible, but there is a lot of potential for the exploitation of the more traditional GT sources in many areas of the world, before the need for the more costly methods arises.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.usgeothermal.com/RaftRiverProject.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.idwr.idaho.gov/WaterInformation/GeothermalResources/geo_default.htm" />

You lift the weight to store the energy in it and then let the weight fall to extract the energy. Many grandfather clocks and cuckoo clocks use this technique. By running the string attached to the weights through a gear train, you can use a heavy weight and let it fall over a long period of time. (See How Pendulum Clocks Work.) This approach doesn't work very well in an electric car, but it has worked well in clocks for hundreds of years.&#xD;&#xA; - Many power plants use the &quot;falling weight&quot; approach in the form of water. The water is pumped uphill to a lake at night when the power plant has excess capacity. During high-demand daytime periods, the water runs through a turbine on its way downhill to a lower lake.&#xD;&#xA; - Another way to store energy is in some form of repeatable mechanical deformation. This is the idea behind a spring used in a wind-up clock or a rubber band used in a wind-up airplane. You store the energy by bending (deforming) the material in a spring, and the material releases the energy as it returns to its original shape. At the scale of a car, this technology has problems because of the weight of the spring, but at smaller scales (like a wristwatch) it works great. See also this page for an interesting example.&#xD;&#xA; - Nature has been storing energy for a long time, and if you want to think about it in this way, gasoline is really a form of stored energy. Plants absorb sunlight and turn it into carbohydrates (see How Food Works for a discussion of carbohydrates). Over millions of years, these carbohydrates can turn into oil or coal. On a more human time scale, we burn wood (which is a carbohydrate) to release stored energy, or turn corn into alcohol and burn the alcohol.&#xD;&#xA; - Another technique that nature uses to store energy is fat, which many of us are familiar with in a personal way. It is interesting to think about a car that somehow eats grass or some other carbohydrate and stores it as fat!&#xD;&#xA; - You can take energy and split water into its hydrogen and oxygen atoms using electrolysis. By storing the hydrogen and oxygen in tanks, you can later create energy by burning it, or (more efficiently) by running it through a fuel cell (see How Fuel Cells Work).&#xD;&#xA; - You can use the energy to spin up a flywheel and then later extract the energy by using the flywheel to run a generator. This patent has lots of information.&#xD;&#xA; - You can store heat directly and later convert the heat to another form of energy like electricity. This page discusses some of NASA's experiments in this area.&#xD;&#xA; - You can use compressed air to store energy. Toys like the Air Hog store energy in this way. Compressing gases like nitrogen enough produces liquid nitrogen, and this page talks about how you can use liquid nitrogen to power a car.&#xD;&#xA; - One of the new technologies that may become available in the future involves antimatter. When you combine normal matter with antimatter, you get energy. You store the energy by creating the antimatter.

Text="I’ve already touched on this topic on the sister SE site [once][1] or [twice][2]. To summarize what is told there (check for more detail), there would be several considerations as related to energy use and sustainability:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Idling in itself wastes fuel for no good reason, and that adds up. In US (country whose residents drive probably more than anyone else on Earth, to put it in perspective) the average cars idles 16 minutes a day (including warming up, waiting, and sitting in traffic). Even 2.0 L compact car would burn (at a rate of 1 L per hour) almost 100 L of fuel a year. Obviously, some idling is unavoidable, but even half of that saved and multiplied by the number of all the cars in the world would amount to significant impact.&#xD;&#xA;* Idling negatively affects the engine internals due to incomplete combustion (glazing of the combustion chamber, fouling of the spark plugs) which further decreases fuel efficiency for all other regimes of operation.&#xD;&#xA;* What’s more, excessive idling affects other components (burning up of the catalytic converter, increased corrosion of exhaust system, increased engine wear due to higher vibration etc.), whose premature wear and replacement lead to increased use of raw materials.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What one can do (and what I do) is to turn off engine during long traffic lights, railway crossings and so forth. Anything more than 10 to 15 seconds (very generously) would save fuel, because car that is already warm does not need that much effort to re-start, as it is at the proper operating temperature, and oil is distributed around the engine and at a high lubricity. Motor stays within the efficient range of temperatures for more than few minutes, and takes several hours to completely cool down (depending on the weather), so there is definitely no need to keep the car running during short errand (never mind someone could simply run off with the vehicle).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any concerns about premature wear of the starting infrastructure are moot considering savings on fuel and other engine components (one could afford to replace starters every 3-4 years at the worst). See the linked posts for detailed arithmetic. And any energy losses that occur during starting, and keeping the electrical loads going during the time the engine is off are minuscule compared to energy used by petrol combustion while idling.

Energy can be stored at pretty much any scale you like, and cost is typically the constrainer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are additional constraints for within-household energy storage: in particular, safety, space and noise. Safety and space will rule out most forms of energy storage: high-energy-density solutions tend to be prone to bad accidents, precisely because they have high energy density.  And low energy density solutions need a lot of space, which is typically limited in households.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Electricity is hard&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Storing electricity, to use as electricity, is a pain at the household level. The constraints above, rule out most of the energy storage solutions proposed in the question. It either takes too much space, or is too highly concentrated, creating a major safety risk.  There are some forms of highly concentrated energy that we have proven means of safe storage: but the capital costs for the round trip from electricity to storage to electricity are high, and the efficiencies are low, making the whole exercise very expensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**These constraints rule out pretty much all the suggested methods in the question.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Towards a solution: start with the biggest energy uses&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First look at your biggest energy uses. They are likely to be either heating, or cooling, or both. The good news is that they are easy to store, as low-grade heat or coolth, for 24-48 hours. Possibly more, if you can build some large underground storage.  Rich ancient Romans managed year-round thermal storage with large underground ice houses and heat stores.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your biggest energy uses are also the place to start looking for energy efficiencies too. If you're planning energy storage, then the business case for efficiencies starts looking much better, because you get two sets of savings: the reduced energy costs, and reduced cost of your energy storage capacity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Virtual storage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the timing of energy use can be shifted, then that acts as virtual storage, with 100% efficiency. It may also require little capital investment - maybe a timer or two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Storage efficiency&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Efficiency in and of itself isn't necessarily a meaningful number: it has a direct impact on costs, which do matter. But in its own right, higher is not always better. If all other things are equal (and they rarely are), then higher is generally better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Forms of energy&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all forms of energy are equal. Some, such as low-grade heat or coolth, are easy to store, but can't do much work. Others, such as electricity, are capable of doing a lot of work (electricity is a high-exergy vector), but are very expensive to store directly (supercapacitors). Converting between forms of energy is always less than 100% efficient, and can be expensive.  Similarly, DC electricity and AC electricity are different: conversion each way is less than 100% efficient, and requires dedicated equipment that can be bulky, expensive, noisy, etc. Batteries convert DC electricity to chemical energy for storage, and back again for use; but most household appliances run on AC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###One sketch of a solution&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Do as much energy-efficiency measures as are practicable: LED lights yielding over 100 lumens per watt, lots of thermal insulation, high-efficiency white goods, making the most of natural ventilation, solar gain, and night-time cooling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. run all your heating through a large thermal store, which you charge up whenever energy is readily available. Do the same, as far as possible, with a large ice store, for your cooling needs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Find someone who's converted their household electricity distribution system to DC as much as possible, and has worked out which devices can be run direct off DC. Then copy their successes, and learn from their failures. Find the cheapest chemical batteries (probably lead-acid car batteries as of 2013), and use for round-trip electricity storage. If you have to, get a rectifier and an inverted to do the DC/AC two wa conversion too. I don't know if this is at all practicable, but it looks possible on paper, so someone mut have tried it." />

The gist is that batteries and compressed air fare comparably well in terms of space needs, weight, etc. Since you want to look at costs and at alternatives to batteries, I suggest the following system: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* PV or wind powered compressor with a larger than usual storage tank &#xD;&#xA;* There exist systems to rtegain electrical power from compressed air for industry use, but they would add headaches with grid synchronization etc, so ...&#xD;&#xA;* The stored energy is used to drive air-powered tools directly&#xD;&#xA;* The compressor can additionally be supplied off the grid, yo your workshop is not dependeant on wind or sun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I can't give you a decent cost estimate now, my gut feeling is that this system could be interesting cost wise because you can use mass produced, readily available tools. However, this supposes that power tools are a major part of your electricity demand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An alternative would be to have lots of equipment that runs of 12V or 24V DC, and have air powered generators, thus avoiding the headaches of grid synchronisation." />

It gets slightly difficult when trying to create a standard business case, because different households have different time values of money.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One can also calculate a Net Present Value by discount future benefits and non-cash costs, and that may differ from the current cost of money. Be aware that this can be controversial: see, for example, the discussion around the Stern Review's choice of discount rate for future harm from climate change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the calculation you've presented, in the paper you are reviewing, looks naive. It's missing out on the cost of money. It's also missing out on likely changes in the value of future energy savings, as the cost of energy is likely to change in the future. It might be that the author/s assumed that the two effects would cancel out (i.e. real increases in future energy prices would match the cost of money), but that's quite a hefty simplifying assumption, and I'd expect to see a statement of the assumption in the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Warmth-taking&#xD;&#xA;How much energy is actually saved by renovation varies hugely, and almost never matches the energy savings predicted in advance. There's a phenomenon that's been called variously: comfort-takeback, rebound, warmth-taking, the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate, the Jevons paradox. Essentially, after renovation designed to prevent heat loss, energy used for heating doesn't drop as much as was expected. There are a bunch of putative explanations for this, and there isn't a single right explanation, nor is there a reliable estimate of how large the effect will be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;###Non-cash benefits&#xD;&#xA;And that lack of clarity over warmth-taking brings me to another element usually missed from calculations of the value of renovation: the changes to quality of life that ensue from the renovation. Those can go either way, and might include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - higher security (against crime);&#xD;&#xA; - lower exposure to noise pollution and air pollution from outside;&#xD;&#xA; - higher exposure to pollutants sourced in or under the home (e.g. smoke, radon)&#xD;&#xA; - changes to internal CO2 levels&#xD;&#xA; - changes to risk and prevalence of mould and dust mites." />

Based on this and the Wikipedia article linked in the question comments, I am inclined to say that you need to do very careful research to avoid purchasing &quot;bamboo&quot; products that (1) were processed using harsh chemicals, (2) present possible environmental risks due to the use of those chemicals, and (4) won't readily biodegrade. The answers to (3) and (5) can probably be found by researching rayon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, I think it's best to avoid &quot;bamboo&quot; textiles unless you have found convincing evidence that they were produced in an environmentally-friendly and sustainable way." />

Biogas to grid is a mature technology now, with about 100 active plants in Germany alone. It is also often discussed to use the upgraded biogas as a vehicle fuel, replacing compressed natural gas (CNG). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the fueling station is taking the gas from the grid, it does not make a difference if it is natural gas or biomethane. I'm looking for installations where the gas is produced, stored, upgraded and filled into vehicles on site. As we are talking about gas pressures upwards of 200 bar, energy efficient handling of the gas is not trivial. Any pointer to reference material that goes into the gas management would be greatly appreciated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit to add (after Energy Numbers Answer):  &#xD;&#xA;Gas upgrading to grid-qualioty is to me an understood problem. The headaches arise with the vehicle fuel application. While a gas to grid installation can basically feed gs into the grid as it is produced, an installation for vehicle fuel would face a very uneven demand (the production is always very steady).  &#xD;&#xA;Depending on gas upgrading technology, the gas is delvered at practically air pressure to 5-15 bar. Vehicle fuel needs 200-250 bar. Compressed Natural Gas fueling stations do an interesting juggling act with 3 banks of gas tanks (hih-, mid-, ow pressure) to minimise the energy expenditure in gas compression - and they have the gas grid that delivers on demand.  &#xD;&#xA;With a constant supply (that can't be switched off), you'd need to store that gas between the tanking either at low pressure (and we may be talking 1000 m³/h), or compress it and store it at high pressure - and then minimize the loss of energy when the compressed gas is expanded into a vehicle tank. Also, high pressure storage costs serious money.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is a cost- and energy-effcient way to match supply and demand here?" />

The internal resistance is higher in older and lower-quality batteries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conditions to reuse partially discharged battery&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;From this information you can see that if some of the following conditions are fulfilled you will be able to use the battery in a second device after it is unusable in the first:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 1st device drains relatively high current&#xD;&#xA; - 1st device needs relatively high voltage from a single cell to operate&#xD;&#xA; - battery has an even discharge curve&#xD;&#xA; - battery has high internal resistance&#xD;&#xA; - 2nd device drains lower current&#xD;&#xA; - 2nd device needs lower voltage from a single cell to operate&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So lower the current and voltage the second device needs - more power it can utilize from a partially discharged battery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples of suitable devices which can be powered by partially discharged batteries&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;I think that the following device types can satisfy the conditions stated above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - clocks (both digital and electro-mechanical)&#xD;&#xA; - digital thermometers, pocket digital games with simple graphics&#xD;&#xA; - digital thermostats&#xD;&#xA; - remote commands, wireless keyboards, mouses&#xD;&#xA; - pocket radios and digital audio players&#xD;&#xA; - bicycle led lights, led head lamps, cyclocomputers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other solutions&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Other possibility is to build a power source which will need relatively low voltage per single battery cell.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact some modern devices use more and more efficient power management circuits. The devices need low voltage inside which also helps low power consumption. The low voltage is produced by a power efficient switching voltage stabilizer/regulator which can possibly operate with wide range of input voltage so that batteries can be efficiently discharged to a low voltage and more energy can be retrieved from them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is certainly possible to construct a power source which will generate stabilized electrical power from a possibly large number of half-discharged batteries by using a switching regulator. I have never seen a mention of such a device. The procedure of replacing the batteries would be probably annoying. Because of dependability of such a power source (varying run-time) I would imagine its use for example for charging of other batteries e.g. in cell phones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because partially discharged batteries have various properties they cannot be effectively used connected in series. On fully discharged cells connected into the circuit there would be unnecessary losses and they can even leak the electrolyte. For this reason there should be a separate regulator for each cell which makes the device more expensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my opinion it is practical to use half-discharged batteries in a low power demanding devices mentioned above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More for sustainability&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;Regarding sustainability it is best to avoid using batteries as much as possible. If you use them, prefer low self-discharge and rechargeable batteries (accumulators) with minimum of dangerous substances. Also prefer low power devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.philohome.com/batteries/bat.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/M2j2O.gif" />

If I understood correctly, this number applies to turning your engine off yourself manually.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My question is: **what is the break-even point when using a built-in start-stop system? How can I calculate this threshold for my own car?** More specifically, I drive a [Skoda Fabia Greenline](http://new.skoda-auto.com/en/models/fabia-greenline/) and want to know how long I should keep my engine turned off before it is more economical than leaving it running when stopped.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know that start-stop systems for non-hybrid engines only work when the motor is already warm and that such engines are usually able to restart within half a second, so if you only consider fuel a start-stop restart is more efficiently than a manual restart. But start-stop restarting still costs extra battery power. I suspect that if I only stop the car for 1 second and then restart I will have used more power than if I kept it running, but I don't know if that's really the case and if so where the break-even point is." />

You are likely to get greater participation by putting &quot;one bin per story, alongside the usual trash bins, each serving 4 apartments (10-15 people).&quot; The more convenient you make participating, the more people will do so. This option requires minimal change in routine on the part of users, so you should get more material with this strategy. But it's also a more modest upscale per bin, which could be more manageable...perhaps you could recruit one person per floor to update you on the state of the bin each week? Minimize your time/effort spent checking multiple bins.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. If you centralize the thing, the bin will be a more serious upscale from what you're used to, but you're also likely to get less material overall because it requires greater effort from its users. This may be more manageable logistically and will also show you who in your building is committed to composting by going out of their way to do so...identifying potential allies for a future per-floor management strategy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admirable undertaking, best of luck!" />

They're usually built into a 140 litre wheely bin. We had one with 6 students living in a house but at times struggled to keep it fed because we also had chickens and a composting system. We used to raid the local fruit and vege shop's rubbish bins for extra stuff to feed them, and also used that green waste for general compost in our garden. But it sounds as though you have the opposite problem - too much compostable material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Ceres worm farms][2] ![cut-away view of worm farm][3] ![inside view of wheely bin worm farm][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They're easy to make but the bins are expensive (here ~$AUS100 each). If there is a local user of them it would be worth asking whether you can get some from them as bulk purchase prices tend to be lower. Or look for any kind of large plastic container - I bought a number of 200 litre plastic barrels for ~$AUS15 each (under 10 euro) from a local recycle/reuse merchant (he dealt only in second hand food grade bulk containers). We used them as rainwater barrels, but they would also work as worm farms. Also, the plastic bread trays used to deliver bread are a good source of gratings for the worm farms (ask the local bread factory as they will have a supply of broken ones).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That design would easily scale up to a 220 litre wheely bin, and the advantage is that you can move them easily. You can assemble them and get them started somewhere easy for you, and if people are not using one, or one fails (and gets stinky), you can just wheel it down to the garage and deal with it there.

As a crude rule-of-thumb, that's a value at or below their capacity factors, so say 25% for onshore wind, 45% for offshore wind, and 10-20% for PV depending on latitude. At those levels, the challenge might be just that we need to build some extra transmission infrastructure to bypass bottlenecks that arise because the old grid configuration was built around old unsustainable generation sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How can higher proportions of exogenously-variable renewables, say 30%+ for onshore wind, 45%+ for offshore, 15%+ for PV, be accommodated onto the electricity grid cost-effectively?" />

The other is is storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Span more climates&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Back in the early noughties, Gregor Czisch built a massive optimisation model to look at how to balance a 100% renewables grid at lowest cost, across various geographic areas, as part of his Dipl.Ing degree. His thesis is [freely available in German][1], and the [English translation can be bought from the IET][2]. His other papers (some in English, some in German) are [freely downloadable][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The model found that increasing the area across which solar and wind were captured, and transmitting that power anywhere across the enlarged area, was one of the cheapest ways to incorporate very high levels of wind and solar into the grid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since then, the concept that he and Gregor Giebel developed, of an international supergrid, has really caught on, and the number and size of international electricity connectors (aka interconnectors) has been growing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of Czisch's scenarios, and most subsequent 100% renewables scenarios developed by others, combine this supergrid with storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Energy Storage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of people immediately think of grid storage as being something where you put electricity in, and that later get almost all that electricity out again. But that round-trip electricity storage is only one type of useful storage for the grid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Storage balances the grid by time-shifting *something* to match supply and demand moment-by-moment. Having storage *somewhere* in the chain between the capture of the primary energy, and delivery of the energy service demand, achieves that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Storing energy somewhere in the electricity supply chain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the electricity supply chain. I'll tag each of the links in the chain with a number, for reference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Capture of primary energy  &#xD;&#xA; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;darr;  **1**  &#xD;&#xA;Primary electricity generation  &#xD;&#xA; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;darr;  **2**  &#xD;&#xA;Electricity delivery  &#xD;&#xA; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;darr;  **3**  &#xD;&#xA;Consumption of the energy service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can introduce storage at any of those links, to balance the grid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Biomass in a silo sits at link **1**. The primary energy has been captured from the sun, locked up in carbohydrates in the plant matter, and that plant matter is then stored until electricity is needed, at which point it is burnt, and the heat is used to drive a turbine. Similarly, water in the upper reservoir of a storage hydro plant is also energy storage at link **1**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Round-trip electricity storage, such as pumped hydro storage, chemical batteries, flywheels, and ultra-capacitors, sits at link **2**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Once the electricity has been delivered, it has to be consumed. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the end-use of the energy has to happen at that time. It does in some cases - for example if you want light, it's no easier to store pure light than it is to store pure electricity, so electricity consumption and use of light happen pretty much simultaneously. However, most of our domestic energy consumption is for space heating, space cooling, water heating, and water cooling. And it's very easy to store warmth or coolth, for use later. So it's pretty easy to build lots of storage at link **3**. Particulary when heating (and maybe cooling) services are provided by shared infrastructure, such as a district heating scheme, where mutli-fuel sources including electricity can be harnessed, and storage of hot water and cold water can be centralised, reaping huge economies of scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Some different types of energy storage for the grid, illustrated:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][4] ![enter image description here][5] ![enter image description here][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;sources: [\[1\]][7],[\[2\]][8],[\[3\]][9]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://kobra.bibliothek.uni-kassel.de/handle/urn:nbn:de:hebis:34-200604119596&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.theiet.org/resources/books/renewable/scenarios.cfm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://transnational-renewables.org/Gregor_Czisch/veroeffentlichungen.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/gqb2v.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CzoDm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeoV4.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gordon_Dam.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pimlico_accumulator_tower_1.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pellets_hand.jpg" />

If you watch [this 2013 TedX video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KPdA-qWNdQ), at 9:35 you see what seems to be algae in a tank giving light. However, never in the video did the inventor use the words 'algae lamp' or did he say that the algae are providing energy. Instead he says that he wants to use these **street** lamps for carbon sequestration, so not for lighting! I suspect in the movie they use an external light source to provide light to the algae (they need light and CO2 to grow).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This all is in contrast to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuWDex5mh5Y) published in april 2012. Here they say that they've used a first prototype of an algae lamp in a parking lot in Bordeaux, France. At 0:38 and 0:57 in the movie they briefly show what seems to be an algae lamp, but strangely I haven't been able to find any other pictures of an algae lamp anywhere. Why aren't there any other pictures on the net other than some stills from this video and some clearly fake pictures?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the end of the second movie the inventor explains that he had trouble finding investors and that he doesn't think people are ready for it yet. Personally, I think that the reason that he is saying this is that the lamp doesn't quite work as they intended. I think that either the prototype lamp was a fake, or it was real but turned out to be impractical. Perhaps the parking lot was too dark and the algae died. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you search [the inventor's company website](http://www.fermentalg.com) for the keyword 'lamp' you get 0 hits.

If you watch [this 2013 TedX video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KPdA-qWNdQ), at 9:35 you see what seems to be algae in a tank giving light. However, never in the video did the inventor use the words 'algae lamp' or did he say that the algae are providing energy. Instead he says that he wants to use these **street** lamps for carbon sequestration, so the algae are not for lighting! I suspect in the movie they use an external light source to provide light to the algae (they need light and CO2 to grow).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to [this page](http://www.inspirationgreen.com/algae-co2-scrubber-and-streetlamp.html) in 2007 Pierre Calleja patented an idea about an algae lamp where a battery would be charged via photosynthesis. However, &#xD;&#xA;If you search [the inventor's company website](http://www.fermentalg.com) for the keyword 'lamp' you get 0 hits.

In this scenario the GWP&#xD;&#xA;of the margarine products still does not exceed 50% of the&#xD;&#xA;GWP from the “best” butter (French).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;In summary, two major factors determine the environmental&#xD;&#xA;impact of the butters and margarines:&#xD;&#xA;1. The origin of the fat (milk or vegetable and for the&#xD;&#xA;latter which type of vegetable oil)&#xD;&#xA;2. The fat content.&#xD;&#xA;This is because for all impact categories and all products, the&#xD;&#xA;agricultural stage contributes most to the overall impact of the&#xD;&#xA;product (with the exception of POCP for margarine). The&#xD;&#xA;environmental impact of milk at the farm gate is higher than the&#xD;&#xA;impact of producing oil crops, mainly due to the impact of&#xD;&#xA;methane emissions from enteric fermentation in cows’ digestive&#xD;&#xA;systems, the production or feed for dairy cows and also the&#xD;&#xA;emissions from manure handling.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-010-0220-3" />

If you could do this (and I'm not saying you can't, but I suspect it would be awfully difficult), why not use grass?  Or bamboo?

Bio-luminescent algae in natural conditions can illuminate entire shorelines - but that's a *lot* of algae.

If you watch [this 2013 TedX video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KPdA-qWNdQ), at 9:35 you see what seems to be algae in a tank giving light. However, never in the video did the inventor use the words 'algae lamp' or did he say that the algae are providing energy. Instead he says that he wants to use these **street** lamps for carbon sequestration, so the algae are not for lighting! I suspect in the movie they use an external light source to provide light to the algae (they need light and CO2 to grow).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to [this page](http://www.inspirationgreen.com/algae-co2-scrubber-and-streetlamp.html) in 2007 Pierre Calleja patented an idea about an algae lamp where a battery would be charged via photosynthesis. However, &#xD;&#xA;If you search [the inventor's company website](http://www.fermentalg.com) for the keyword 'lamp' you get 0 hits. This all leads me to believe that they first tried to develop algae lamps but failed and are now pursuing a different approach and that is using algae for carbon sequestration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT**: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was able to find [a paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl903141j) that describes how scientists from Stanford University and Yonsei University in Seoul managed to attach the gold electrodes to the&#xD;&#xA;cells of an algae. Unfortunately I don't have access to the full paper, but [this 2010 Stanford news release](http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2010/pr-electric-current-plants-041310.html) provides some additional information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Stanford research team developed a unique, ultra-sharp nanoelectrode made of gold, specially designed for probing inside cells. They gently pushed it through the algal cell membranes, which sealed around it, and the cell stayed alive. From the photosynthesizing cells, the electrode collected electrons that had been energized by light and the researchers generated a tiny electrical current.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The news article also describes the problems: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...they were able to draw from each cell just one picoampere, an amount of electricity so tiny that they would need a trillion cells photosynthesizing for one hour just to equal the amount of energy stored in a AA battery. In addition, the cells die after an hour. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example, one idea is the fruit forest, which is supposed to be like an abandoned orchard, with plants at seven levels, as you say.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Root crops are not in one particular place, but &quot;crop up&quot; all over the garden. You should only dig, when you want to harvest. And you should only harvest so much that a couple of plants flower and &quot;crop up&quot; in the next season.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In that sense, I think that traditional permaculture à la Morrison doesn't deal much with crops that are rotational in nature. In particular, Morrison suggests in several places that potatoes should be the staple for any gardener.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fukuoka, however, has developed a method to rotate rice and wheat (by sowing the grain in form of clay pellets to protect them from birds and insects) which is much in line with permaculture principles.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the basic idea is to not rotate crops, because you don't really have &quot;crops&quot;. You have a big and abundant garden, which produces fruit &amp; vegetables all year round, without having to have a sowing and harvesting season. The extent to which this works out is, of course, dependent on your climate. The reason this can work at all, according to permaculture, is good design." />

However, dust can settle on the heating element, and you can't reach it to clean it, so you get the smell of burnt dust.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**oil-filled radiatior:** If you want a slow-to-respond heater that will have a lot of thermal mass, so it will warm up slowly, and cool down slowly, that will give comfort advantages, but if you turn it off when you no longer need the heat, it will continue to radiate for some time, as the oil in it cools down, and that could be a waste of energy. If part of the heater's duty will be to help dry clothes, this radiator might be your best option.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**inrfa-red lamp:** If it's for a room where you'll spend a time with a lot of skin exposed, and if you're ok with the air being relatively cold but your skin feeling warm (like being in full sun on a winter's day), then the infra-red heater is the thing." />

In [this link][1] on the physics SE it was estimated to be 1 / 4000 of a gallon of gasoline to re-start the motor.  The number given there for idling of .3 gal / hour is consistent with my observation of .24 gal / hour in my Prius.

Molds are useful and help decomposing the bin contents. However, you do have to regulate the moisture level of your worm bin! If a worm bin is too wet it will start to smell and the worms won't like a lot of water. If a bin becomes excessively wet your worms may even die and/or drown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most worm bins have a draining system for draining superfluous liquid. It is not very hard to add such a system to your bin. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Option1:** Add a raised floor to the inside of your bin, for example made from the bottom of a similar-sized container. You'll have to make some small holls in the second floor so the water can seep through. If you then add a small tap at the outside bottom, you can drain the water every now and then. &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**Option2:** Alternatively you can make some small holls directly in the floor of your bin. It's best to place the bin in a raised position in another open container so you can catch any fluid when it drips out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the first option you still have a closed system, so there is no worry of smell. A drawback is that it may not be easy to add a tap that doesn't leak around the edges.&#xD;&#xA;The second option is easier to achieve, but any water dripping out is right in the open, so there may be a smell.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from adding a drainage system, there is another alternative. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Option3:** Carefully regulate the moisture content of your bin. This may not be easy, but it is doable. You'll probably have to dry wet materials like fruit peelings a bit before you can add them to your bin. If the bin still is becoming too wet, add dry cardboard or paper to get back to the correct moisture level. If you've dried your materials too much and the bin is not wet enough, simply spray with a bit of water.&#xD;&#xA; " />

Glass is made of friendly natural materials, but it takes a lot of energy to produce (it has to be melted!).  Shipping glass is tricky, raising the footprint.  Worst of all, though, glass is a poor insulator.  If you're going to bury it underground then there really is no point, there are many other options which are inexpensive and very locally sourced, such as straw bales or rammed earth.  Glass should be used to allow light (and heat) into the home, often at a sacrifice to insulation (which can be made up for during the day with correct planning).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are looking for prefab homes there are a variety of items which already exist, such as shipping containers, which have a small footprint in that nothing new need be constructed.

The problem comes when too many of them are blocked off (the furnace can't push enough air to work effectively). If you also have an exit vent in your room a [door snake][2] will help keep the warm air from the rest of the house out, once you've partly closed off the register.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first question is much harder. I've lived in share houses for 20 years or so, and have not found a reliable answer. Which is especially odd given that most of those houses have been full of explicitly eco-friendly folk. The answers are the same as any political campaign or social change movement, but applied to a very small group of people (your roommates).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It sounds as though you've already done the &quot;ask them&quot; step, and probably the &quot;explain why&quot; step. If not, do that. Saving money is usually the big win.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You'd probably be better addressing the highest cost areas first. Lights are usually minor, especially if you're using compact fluorescent bulbs or LEDs already. Heat loss is where the money goes, and leaving a window open when the heating on is going to really hurt you. I suspect you will find they do it to get rid of the steam, and the usual solution is an extractor fan linked to the light switch. But it's not your house so that's not an option. If you have a mould prblem you could speak to your landlord about that, and see if they will install a fan. But regardless, the real solution is to persuade the roommate not to leave the window open.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First make sure the roommates, especially the window-opening one, understand the problem of heat loss, that it costs money, and makes the house colder in that area. Ideally get some of them on side, because peer pressure works. In the worst case, if everyone except that person is annoyed enough you can kick the problem person out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next you just have to work on the behaviour change.

If you keep an eye on how long this takes, you (or your roommate) could use a timer to remember to shut it, though it will differ somewhat depending on weather conditions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, a ventilation fan may cause even more heat loss than an open window, but you might feel it elsewhere depending on where it draws in cold air from. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Running a dehumidifier and leaving the window shut might be a good compromise?

Satellite photos shows increase of green color in last decades, what means increased consumption of carbon dioxine.

Another green-gases are more involved in that than CO2, for example methane or just simple water wapours. According to my opinion, most involved in global warming/cooling is the solar activity during solar cycles, number of active sun spots and Earth distance from the Sun. There was warmer and colder eras which could NOT be caused by human activity from era of cathedrals in 14-15th century, when good wine was imported to France from Notrth England (today is not possible,there is not a good wine growing there) to small ice age in 18-19th century when people could ice-skating on river Thames (Temže) during winter time (does not get frozen from early 20th century for whole year)." />

The ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere and ocean surface waters is steadily falling, showing that more carbon-12 is entering the atmosphere.  This ratio doesn't directly correspond to world ppm or even relate directly to the quantity released because they are just looking at the ratio.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This change in ratio is only tracked to show there is a correlation between human activity and $CO_2$.  The same can be said about the relative drop in carbon-14 as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The carbon cycle is complex and different sink absorption times and source release times make it hard to separate from the current ppm measurements.  It is probably impossible to say 10% is from X, 15% is from Y and 75% is from Z.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is well tracked is the industrial and human sources which have climbed.  The question still out there is how well do the sinks work?  What are their limits/tradeoffs?  What new sources might arise in a warmer climate?  It's possible a small amount of man-made $CO_2$ could cause a larger release of natural $CO_2$ and create a domino effect of warming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general the human related output of 29 gigatons of $CO_2$ is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, but it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra $CO_2$. [About 40% of this additional $CO_2$ is absorbed][1]. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric $CO_2$ is at its [highest level in 15 to 20 million years][2]. A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [predictive models of the temperate cycle based on greenhouse gases and energy input/outputs][3] can be tested against observations to see what might contribute to the temperature rise.&#xD;&#xA;![models][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit:&#xD;&#xA;In one of the links I provided was from the IPCC.  Thousands of scientists and other experts contribute (on a voluntary basis, without payment from the IPCC) to writing and reviewing reports, which are reviewed by representatives from all the governments, with a Summary for Policymakers being subject to line-by-line approval by all participating governments. Typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [their report linked above][5] (which you must read completely if you're serious about this subject) they summarize the increase of greenhouse gases:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For about a thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remained relatively&#xD;&#xA;&gt; constant. Since then, the concentration of various greenhouse gases&#xD;&#xA;&gt; has increased. The amount of carbon dioxide, for example, has&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increased by more than 30% since pre-industrial times and is still&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increasing at an unprecedented rate of on average 0.4% per year,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mainly due to the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. We&#xD;&#xA;&gt; know that this increase is anthropogenic because the changing isotopic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; composition of the atmospheric CO2 betrays the fossil origin of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increase. The concentration of other natural radiatively active&#xD;&#xA;&gt; atmospheric components, such as methane and nitrous oxide, is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increasing as well due to agricultural, industrial and other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; activities. The concentration of the nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of carbon monoxide (CO) are also increasing. Although these gases are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not greenhouse gases, they play a role in the atmospheric chemistry&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and have led to an increase in tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by 40% since pre-industrial times (Chapter 4).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The idea is that over decades we can measure our human based output and then measure the increase in the sinks vs atmosphere.  Then we can estimate how much contributes to the overall atmosphere.  Since sinks can sources all have different carbon time cycles you can not say &quot;this year x% of the ppm increase is anthropomorphic&quot;.  You can say that over the decades we see that x% produced leads to y% absorbed and a corresponding z% increase in the atmosphere.  But as the sinks saturate and temperatures change they change too, so it is not a rule but a dynamic system which we try to model to understand it.  We model these complex systems **so that we can answer the types of abstract questions you are asking**.  &quot;What does this measured ppm increase mean exactly?  What are the possible contributors?  What happens yearly?  What happens monthly?  Why is the average temperature increasing by x?  What happens if XX process doubles, or halves?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Given that CO2 has such a major role in the natural greenhouse effect,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it makes intuitive sense that changes in its concentration because of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; human activities might significantly enhance the greenhouse effect.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, calculating the impact of a change in CO2 is very different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from calculating the current role with respect to water vapor and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clouds. This is because both of these other substances depend on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; temperatures and atmospheric circulation in ways that CO2 does not.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For instance, as temperature rises, the maximum sustainable water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; vapor concentration increases by about 7% per degree Celsius. Clouds&#xD;&#xA;&gt; too depend on temperature, pressure, convection and water vapor&#xD;&#xA;&gt; amounts. So a change in CO2 that affects the greenhouse effect will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; also change the water vapor and the clouds. Thus, the total greenhouse&#xD;&#xA;&gt; effect after a change in CO2 needs to account for the consequent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changes in the other components as well. If, for instance, CO2&#xD;&#xA;&gt; concentrations are doubled, then the absorption would increase by 4&#xD;&#xA;&gt; W/m2, but once the water vapor and clouds react, the absorption&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increases by almost 20 W/m2 — demonstrating that (in the GISS climate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; model, at least) the &quot;feedbacks&quot; are amplifying the effects of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; initial radiative forcing from CO2 alone. Past climate data suggests&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that this is what happens in the real world as well.

The same can be said about the relative drop in carbon-14 as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The carbon cycle is complex and different sink absorption times and source release times make it hard to separate from the current ppm measurements.  It is probably impossible to say 10% is from X, 15% is from Y and 75% is from Z.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is well tracked is the industrial and human sources which have climbed.  The question still out there is how well do the sinks work?  What are their limits/tradeoffs?  What new sources might arise in a warmer climate?  It's possible a small amount of man-made CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could cause a larger release of natural CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and create a domino effect of warming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general the human related output of 29 gigatons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, but it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [About 40% of this additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is absorbed][1]. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is at its [highest level in 15 to 20 million years][2]. A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [predictive models of the temperate cycle based on greenhouse gases and energy input/outputs][3] can be tested against observations to see what might contribute to the temperature rise.&#xD;&#xA;![models][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit:&#xD;&#xA;In one of the links I provided was from the IPCC.  Thousands of scientists and other experts contribute (on a voluntary basis, without payment from the IPCC) to writing and reviewing reports, which are reviewed by representatives from all the governments, with a Summary for Policymakers being subject to line-by-line approval by all participating governments. Typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [their report linked above][5] (which you must read completely if you're serious about this subject) they summarize the increase of greenhouse gases:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For about a thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remained relatively&#xD;&#xA;&gt; constant. Since then, the concentration of various greenhouse gases&#xD;&#xA;&gt; has increased. The amount of carbon dioxide, for example, has&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increased by more than 30% since pre-industrial times and is still&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increasing at an unprecedented rate of on average 0.4% per year,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mainly due to the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. We&#xD;&#xA;&gt; know that this increase is anthropogenic because the changing isotopic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; composition of the atmospheric CO2 betrays the fossil origin of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increase. The concentration of other natural radiatively active&#xD;&#xA;&gt; atmospheric components, such as methane and nitrous oxide, is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increasing as well due to agricultural, industrial and other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; activities. The concentration of the nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of carbon monoxide (CO) are also increasing. Although these gases are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not greenhouse gases, they play a role in the atmospheric chemistry&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and have led to an increase in tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by 40% since pre-industrial times (Chapter 4).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The idea is that over decades we can measure our human based output and then measure the increase in the sinks vs atmosphere.  Then we can estimate how much contributes to the overall atmosphere.  Since sinks can sources all have different carbon time cycles you can not say &quot;this year x% of the ppm increase is anthropomorphic&quot;.  You can say that over the decades we see that x% produced leads to y% absorbed and a corresponding z% increase in the atmosphere.  But as the sinks saturate and temperatures change they change too, so it is not a rule but a dynamic system which we try to model to understand it.  We model these complex systems **so that we can answer the types of abstract questions you are asking**.  &quot;What does this measured ppm increase mean exactly?  What are the possible contributors?  What happens yearly?  What happens monthly?  Why is the average temperature increasing by x?  What happens if XX process doubles, or halves?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Given that CO2 has such a major role in the natural greenhouse effect,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it makes intuitive sense that changes in its concentration because of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; human activities might significantly enhance the greenhouse effect.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, calculating the impact of a change in CO2 is very different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from calculating the current role with respect to water vapor and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clouds. This is because both of these other substances depend on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; temperatures and atmospheric circulation in ways that CO2 does not.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For instance, as temperature rises, the maximum sustainable water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; vapor concentration increases by about 7% per degree Celsius. Clouds&#xD;&#xA;&gt; too depend on temperature, pressure, convection and water vapor&#xD;&#xA;&gt; amounts. So a change in CO2 that affects the greenhouse effect will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; also change the water vapor and the clouds. Thus, the total greenhouse&#xD;&#xA;&gt; effect after a change in CO2 needs to account for the consequent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changes in the other components as well. If, for instance, CO2&#xD;&#xA;&gt; concentrations are doubled, then the absorption would increase by 4&#xD;&#xA;&gt; W/m2, but once the water vapor and clouds react, the absorption&#xD;&#xA;&gt; increases by almost 20 W/m2 — demonstrating that (in the GISS climate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; model, at least) the &quot;feedbacks&quot; are amplifying the effects of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; initial radiative forcing from CO2 alone. Past climate data suggests&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that this is what happens in the real world as well.

(On a warm winter day, it would be 50 in the afternoon and 40 after dark; on a colder day it might be 10 or 20 degrees colder in both instances.)

Also slight copyediting and clarification." Text="### General principles&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The important thing here is to realise *what* these heaters heat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Radiative heaters radiate infra-red light which strikes objects and heats them directly, heating the intervening air less.&#xD;&#xA;* Fan heaters primarily heat the air in the room by [forced convection][1].&#xD;&#xA;* Oil filled radiators, work like ordinary central heating radiators, primarily heating the air in the room by [natural convection][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are heating a space with ventilation but no heat recovery (you open a door or window regularly, or have a draught) then a fan heater or radiator would be less useful than a radiative heater. Much of the heat you generate will escape with the air which escapes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are in a space where there is little likelihood of hot air escaping, but where the walls are thin and poorly insulated, then a fan heater might be better. While some of the heat from the radiative heater will strike you and heat you directly, the energy which hits the walls will be divided between radiating back into the room and escaping through the wall.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a well insulated room with little escape of air, there would be negligible differences between the different methods other than perceptual ones. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Safety&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is usually recommended that radiative and fan heaters are not left running when unattended. Even when an oil filled radiator is rated for unattended operation, care should be taken, as with any heating device, that nothing flammable is left close to or in contact with the heater.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Care should also be taken with these heaters when used in a room where people are sleeping. If there is **any** chance that they could be knocked over, or bedding/clothes could fall on them and pose fire risk, do not use the heater.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, in kitchens and bathrooms, only use appliances rated for use in those rooms. Moisture in the air could cause a heater not rated for those environments to fail, posing an additional fire risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Personal experience&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From personal experience, I always *feel* warmer in front of a radiative heater, and they certainly produce less noise pollution than fan heaters, so are more pleasant to be around. Both are more controllable than oil frilled radiators, so you get heat out of them sooner after you need it and waste little heat when you no longer need it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I find infra-red heaters particularly useful in bathrooms. Heaters like the following are (or were) common in UK bathrooms:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Dimplex IRX120N - 1200 Watt Infra Red Wall Heater - Image used without permission, but with attribution][3]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way to use a heater like this is on demand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't normally heat my bathroom, but I turn on my bathroom IR wall heater before I get in the shower so it is up to full heat by the time I get out of the shower. The infra-red heat keeps me nice and warm in those those crucial moments between stopping the hot water flow and towelling off the rapidly cooling water. I then turn off the heater as I leave the bathroom, having wasted little electricity unnecessarily heating it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have never understood why people replace IR wall heaters in bathrooms with fan heaters. I find that they can never warm up the air in the bathroom enough during the time you are showering that you don't feel cold during the towelling. I know that IR heaters are seen as *old technology*, but they work very well, are as 'efficient' as every other electric heater and are far more reliable than fan heaters. I have never had a fan heater last more than a decade, the IR heater in my bathroom has been working for over three.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection#Forced_convection&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection#Natural_convection&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.tlc-direct.co.uk/Images/Products/size_3/DXIRX120N.JPG&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.tlc-direct.co.uk/Products/DXIRX120N.html" />

Given that there is a fairly narrow range of interior temperatures that we might want, that is nearly equivalent, but it does mean that there is only a limited extent to which this &quot;pre-heating&quot; approach can work - once you warm the house a certain amount above your normally preferred temperature, the CoP of the pump will be reduced in the same way as it is when it is cold outside.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately, as you have identified, whether this strategy is worthwhile will depend very much upon the house and the heat pump: if the house is very well insulated, and thus heat loss from it is small, then the suggested scheme ought to work. If not, then the additional heat loss from the house being at a higher temperature may be greater than the benefit gained from the higher CoP. It may be possible for others to give a rule of thumb or an answer from experience, but the only way that I think you can sure is to test it, and even that is tricky:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a period of time (perhaps a week) try this &quot;pre-heating&quot; strategy. Record the exterior temperature that day and evening, and the amount of energy used by your heating system, each day.&#xD;&#xA;For another similar period of time use a more conventional strategy (have the heating on when you want the warmth), making sure that the thermostat is set to the same level at the same time except for the pre-heat period. Record the same items.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Identify similar days between the two data sets, and compare the energy use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Difficulties that may be faced:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Depending on your metering arrangements, isolating the energy used by the heating system from other load in the house.&#xD;&#xA;2. If the house is well-insulated, having the same exterior temperature on two days does not necessarily mean that the house starts at the same interior temperature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: I've assumed an air-source heat pump.

I suspect that the only difference with other commercial systems is that they sell their own mix of [Effective Microorganisms (EM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_Microorganisms). This mix is probably slightly different from the already existing and trademarked mixes, but the principle of how to use it is still the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From what I've gathered on the website the Smartbins are airtight (this is necessary when composting with EM). This means that if the bin is closed, there is no chance of any odors coming out. However there probably is a soury smell if the bin is opened, for example when you add more food scraps or when you add the compost at the end of stage one. Usually the smell is nothing too bad, but if you dislike it you may want to open it outside.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see no reason why the Smartbin cannot be used by a family of two, or by a single person for that matter. You just gather all your food scraps until the bin is full (or half full is you leave space for adding compost later). If you don't generate much food waste just make sure you use a small bin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to DIY, you'll have to buy your own airtight bins. There are many tutorials on the internet, for example [this one is very easy to DIY](http://snapguide.com/guides/make-a-bokashi-bin/) or you can create [one with a tap to drain fluids more easily](http://www.underthechokotree.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=181:making-your-own-bokashi-bucket&amp;catid=51:keeping-the-place-fertile&amp;Itemid=37).&#xD;&#xA;Besides a bin, you need to create an EM starter culture. Again there are many tutorials on the internet, [here](http://newspaperbokashi.wordpress.com/tag/diy-bokashi-starter-recipe/) is an example. Note that creating a EM culture will take about 3 weeks and you'll have to create new EM every now and then when you run out of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Check the attic, restore old windows, add storm windows, weather stripping to doors.

More efficient traditional units can get breaks too if upgrading.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may consider augmenting your traditional furnace with biomass.  Pellet stoves can be fairly affordable.  If you pay for your own utilities you may not concern your landlord with the price, but you will need to cut a hole in the house for the ventilation.  There are attractive models, even, which could improve the house value. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Appliances**: Some inefficient devices can be replaced, such as old water heaters.  More efficient models are available and also alternative systems, such as on-demand (not popular in the US, though).

For spotlighting, for low output requirements, or for areas that are switched on and off very frequently, look at LED. If you really cannot stand to move away from an incandescent glow, or you need a light to be dimmable, use tungsten halogen lamps - preferably the low voltage variety, which are substantially more efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For all of these technology types, it is worth paying for a reputable brand (e.g. Osram, Philips, GE). CFLs and LEDs have gained a bad reputation with some people due to cheap versions failing early. The same applies to the transformers in low voltage halogen fixtures. If moving to LEDs, buy one first to check that you are happy with the colour - the quality of &quot;white&quot; varies widely. If moving to CFL or LED, don't trust the manufacturers' claims on &quot;equivalent wattage&quot; - instead, look at the number of lumens that they produce.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Heat&#xD;&#xA;-------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is slightly less cheap and easy, but some measures are still straightforward. If you are in even a moderately cold climate, heat will probably account for about half of your domestic energy use, so reducing this is potentially a big saving.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure that there is a good amount (up to 200-300mm) of modern loft insulation in your roof. This is quick and cheap to install, and without it all of your heat rises straight out the top of the house.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If you get draughts under doors, etc., fit draught excluders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Make sure windows are double (or even triple) glazed. Moving from single to double glazing in particular is a major improvement in insulation. Potentially expensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Wall insulation depends very much upon the walls. If you have cavity walls, get them filled with insulating foam. If you have solid walls, there are insulating panels that you can fit on the inside, but this does reduce the size of your rooms. As an alternative, take inspiration from medieval times and put wool hangings on the inside of the walls.

Depending on what people are like to start with, this can potentially be a huge saving, and it has no cost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Another cultural change: If people can be happy wearing a jumper, rather than expecting to be comfortable year-round in a thin sleeveless top, you can make major savings in heating.

I don't need to make any profit if it helps her and the environment, however, I make pretty good interest in my charitable fund so any money I contribute to help her has to provide sufficient savings to make up for my opportunity cost of not earning interest on that money until I'm refunded while slowly working towards refunding my initial investment and *still* giving her some sort of savings to make it worth her while; in other words we can do larger expenditures but only if they give fairly substantial savings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can anyone suggest which options are best to suggest to my landlord?  I know in the long run a solar panels would be a good option, but they are large enough of an upfront investment that it may be hard to convince her to look into; However, I would love more details about them, in particular any hidden expense (for instance, extra effort to maintain them, clear them off, etc) which I may not be aware of but she deserves to know going in.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any other good options to recommend to her are welcome.  I need things that aren't asking for too heavy a time investment from her to do, I'm happy to invest some of my time but I don't own the house so only so much I can do there; plus I'm pretty disorganized myself lol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We live in Maryland with 3 adults and one child living in the house.  The house is a somewhat older house with two stories plus a furnished underground basement used as a playroom, just in case any of that matters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps. if we do something that would warrant tax credits is there any way I can pay for it and claim the tax credit as a resident but not home owner?  My tax bracket is a bit higher then hers so I would get a larger savings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT:&#xD;&#xA;I should have said this sooner since it's obviously relevant; I sort of took it for granted.  Our utilities are included in our rent, so she is paying the full cost for all utilities.  She also lives in, and owns, the house, so maybe 'landlord' is a slightly misleading title :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The house is both heated in the winter and cooled (AC) in the winter. Since we're in MD we probably are a little north, probably spend more of the year heating the AC etc." />

But to try to do both at the same time, is going to hit efficiency badly. There is no free energy - it's all got to come from somewhere, and it's all got to end up somewhere else: the same quantity, just in different forms. So if you're turning some of the incoming water's kinetic energy into increased gravitational potential, there will be much less work generated by the turbine that is available for other purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And equipment tends to be most efficient, when it's used for the purpose that it's designed for.

There are two main resons for that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, when hydrocarbons are burnt to provide movement, local pollution is released: NOx, particulates, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And secondly, it's much easier to clean electricity, than to clean hydrocarbons. That's because the clean electricity resource is affordable and plentiful: solar, hydro and wind can together power the world many many times over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Efficiency turns out to be a useful proxy, occasionally. But often it's misleading - it doesn't really get to the core of what we need to know. Electric engines are about four times as efficient as internal combustion engines. The efficiency of any wider system, would depend on where you draw the system boundary. And then you're adding up efficiencies that may or may not make sense. Wind, water and sunlight are free: does it make sense to include the efficiencies at which they are harvested? Efficiency is one of many things that affects the economics: but there are sufficient other factors that can more than make up for low efficiency." />

We already have all the technology we need for 100% renewable electricity grids combined with the electrification of urban transport and heating. And for most countries, that's more economic than any alternative, once the externalities (pollution, liability cover) are priced in. What's missing is political will and vision. And that is, in part, driven by ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Industrial incumbents&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like most countries, Ireland has industrial incumbents with a lot of fixed assets (with sunk costs) that are dedicatd to highly-polluting ways to do things. So they carry a lot of economic weight, and consequentially political weight too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###One much larger neighbour&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For most countries, large-capacity interconnectors to several neighbours provide the best option for balancing a grid with a high (&gt;50%) proportion of exogenously-variable renewables such as wind, wave, tidal and solar: and Ireland's potential renewables are mostly of that kind, with relatively little scope for geothermal or storage hydro.  However, Ireland, being on the continental periphery, has just one close neighbour, that is much larger than it. And that means the bigger the interconnectors, the more that prices on the all-Ireland grid would get driven largely by what's happening on the British grid, which makes it politically and economically challenging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Balancing the grid at the scale of quarter-cycle to seconds&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exogenously-variable renewables such as wind don't necessarily bring much inertia to the grid, unlike thermal plant (and in particular coal). So the sort of balancing of supply and demand (aka balancing) that happens very easily on a grid with lots of fossil plant, at the scale of quarter-cycle (5ms on a 50Hz grid) to a few seconds, needs more planning and realigned incentives on a wind-rich grid. Technically, it's a solved problem - Quebec's grid, and others, have incentivised the innovation of within-turbine grid-balancing services at these time scales. What's missing, is a successful model for economic incentivisation to ensure the best balance of the maximisation of generated electricity, with sufficient balancing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Rural, water and air transport&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rural, water and air transport remain challenges for most countries. Hydrocarbons provide a very high ratio of energy per unit mass, and per unit volume, and those are incredibly valuable for motorised transport. There are a bunch of options: biogenic hydrocarbons, synthetic hydrocarbons, hydrogen, some putative new chemical battery - but as yet there are no clear winners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Things which had looked like challenges, but now have known solutions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Size of the available renewable resource&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It used to be thought that that might be an issue, and some people got worried because energy per unit land area seemed to be low. That turned out to be a non-issue, once people did the maths. The island of Ireland's total energy consumption (electricity, heat, transport, etc) is about 21.5GW ([15GW][1] for Eire, 6.5GW for Northern Ireland). Its land area is 84&amp;nbsp;421&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and its sea area is well over 400&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning that even at the 2W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that non-optimised onshore wind gives, sufficiency of the available resource is not a challenge: only a tiny fraction of Ireland's land and waters would need renewables, to meet all current energy consumption, and that's without any energy efficiency measures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;(I've no intention of causing conflict by considering the island as a whole: the grids of Eire and Northern Ireland are combined, and the same wind, sun, tides and waves reach both parts of the island. So it's just technically easier to analyse the island of Ireland as one whole entity)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Balancing the grid at the scale of minutes to days&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, this used to be a problem, but now we're spoilt for solutions. Electricity interconnectors to neighbours do raise challenges of political economics, but in terms of capital investment they're very affordable, and provide a technical solution for most of the problem. The rest can be taken care of through sustainable biomass and power-to-gas. There has been a project to lobby for extensive pumped hydro storage in Eire, but the economics don't currently look favourable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Forecastability of the weather&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are no countries immediately to the west or south-west of Ireland; and that's the direction that most of the weather comes in from. That means that Ireland has fewer opportunities than most of the rest of Europe to gather free weather information for 4-hour and 24-hour ahead forecasts. However, with the growing use of weather buoys, weather masts and floating LiDAR, complemented by satellite data, this is a solved problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.wellandwarm.ie/Publications/Statistics_Publications/EPSSU_Publications/Energy_in_Ireland_Key_Statistics/Energy_in_Ireland_Key_Statistics_2012.pdf" />

We know bugs and fungi will attack organic matter such as the Christmas trees once there is the opportunity to. There are pesticides and herbicides used throughout the life of the tree and these are all known to have residual effects that can last many years. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Surveys carried out by Dr. Steve Toth, Pesticide Impact Specialist with North Carolina State University found the use of many pesticides and herbicides such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pesticides&#xD;&#xA; 1. Di-Syston&#xD;&#xA; 2. Lindane&#xD;&#xA; 3. Dimethoate&#xD;&#xA; 4. Asana&#xD;&#xA; 5. Lorsban&#xD;&#xA; 6. Savey&#xD;&#xA; 7. Morestan&#xD;&#xA; 8. Talstar&#xD;&#xA; 9.

Crossbow&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These help greatly to increase the shelf lives of the trees but we have some idea as the the kind of effects these chemicals can have especially after long-term exposure. It can be argued that the kind of exposure we undergo from the short period of owning the these trees would not necessarily be cause for concern. However, it is my guess and many other people's that anything designed to kill bugs and weeds is usually toxic to humans. Therefore there ought to be some concern there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can always ask who you purchase the tree from about their chemical usage and this sort of information should be readily available to the customer. If you want to get trees that are not exposed to such chemicals, you can purchase certified organic trees. Organic farming reduces and in most cases eliminates the use of such chemicals. These methods are a bit more expensive but it helps in reducing or limiting our exposure to chemicals." />

Spoiler alert: this is largely about a conspiracy theory. I know that will turn a lot of people off, but you have to realize that if people automatically dismiss all conspiracy theories as false, then you have completely cleared the way for conspiracies to be carried out without limits. (What's the phrase about the devil's greatest trick being convincing people that he didn't exist?)&#xD;&#xA;* **[Heat](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/heat/)**: What companies and governments around the world think about tackling climate change.&#xD;&#xA;* **[Poisoned Waters][14]:** An investigation into pollution of US waterways.&#xD;&#xA;* **[Who Killed the Electric Car?][5]**: Why did electric cars stop being produced by major automakers in the mid-2000s?&#xD;&#xA;* **[Food, Inc.][8]**: The environmental and health problems with the way food is produced in the developed world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Describing Solutions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **[No Impact Man][9]** (5 of 5 stars): Follow a man in New York City as he tries to live for one year with almost no negative environmental impact.&#xD;&#xA;* **[Fuel][2]** (5 of 5 stars): This is a good layperson's introduction to biofuels. No more, no less. Its not a scientific documentary, so if you're craving proof, pick up a science journal. If you want to learn a bit about a subject that you have only been very casually acquainted with, then watch this.&#xD;&#xA;* **[Revenge of the Electric Car][6]**: An examination of 3 automakers (Nissan/GM/Tesla) bringing electric cars to mass markets.&#xD;&#xA;* **[Car of the Future][7]**: An entertaining look at emerging alternative fuel vehicle technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Ones to Avoid&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**[Cool It][4]** (1 of 5 stars): If you don't trust science, or are looking for excuses to not change any of your habits, you'll love this movie. A few facts: first, Lomborg's not a professor of environmental science. He's a political scientist. Half of the experts he interviewed were also not natural scientists, but economists.

The longer the insulation lasts, the greater its contribution to your home's sustainability. It is also important to select insulation that can be installed easily, without tearing out walls and producing unnecessary waste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some factors to consider:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Building style:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you building a new home or simply upgrading an existing house? It simply isn't practical to re-do an existing home with straw-bale walls, but you can easily fill an attic with fiberglass, cellulose, denim, or other loose insulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Continuing from that, the type of building material used is also a major factor. You can't put loose-fill cellulose in a poured concrete wall, but you can use insulating concrete forms or foam boards. Wood houses have a lot of cavities that make blown-in insulation an attractive option, especially for retrofits. Filling empty cavities with cellulose or fiberglass is a fairly non-invasive strategy for wood structures as it only requires you to drill holes in the wall then plug them again. But if you are already re-siding the house, foam boards under the new siding might be an attractive option.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sunlight damages most insulating foams.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Climate:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humidity can damage many types of insulation, and your choice of insulation will affect (or depend on) your strategies for dealing with moisture produced in the home or entering from outside.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Pests:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mice are happy to nest in fiberglass, as reported on the [DIY/Home Improvement](http://diy.stackexchange.com/) sister site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sustainable materials:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Straw bale construction works well if you can find a contractor in your area familiar with it or if you have the skills to do it yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wool insulation (mentioned in the question) is sustainable if wool is produced in excess near the house in question. If you would have to make special arrangements to have it shipped from a far away place, you should consider other options." />

Anyone wanting to add waste generation and other considerations please feel free. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chad is right that the question depends first on how your kids live and where you decide to live. Geography and economy are very important variables.  A study by [Chris Jones](http://www.stanford.edu/group/peec/cgi-bin/docs/events/2009/becc/presentations/1F%20Jones%20BECC%20Final.pdf) at UC Berkeley broke the average carbon footprints of the US and world as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080428120658.htm) has the total figures as 20 and 4 tons for the US and world respectively.  I suggest this has to do with Jones accounting of indirect supply chain emissions he calculated using [lifecycle input output analysis](http://www.eiolca.net/), so I tend to trust his figures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A [paper Jones published](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es102221h) in Environmental Science and Technology showed, using the same methodologies, that these distributions can vary substantially.  For instance, a comparison of San Francisco vs St. Louis showed the following differences:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - transportation emissions 2x as high in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA; - housing emissions over 2x as high in SL compared to SF&#xD;&#xA; - food emissions twice as high in SL compared to SF&#xD;&#xA; - goods emissions ~30% higher in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA; - service emissions ~40% higher in SF compared to SL&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because I'm not sure which locations you are choosing between, I can't say what categories will be most important to you, so I'll use the average US case.  Based on Jones' analysis we see that transportation, electricity and heating are good place to start to look at reducing your carbon impact.  The first consideration you should therefore make is your traveling habits at the two different places:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - As a retired person will you be traveling on vacation a lot?  Using&#xD;&#xA;   [EPA Climate Leaders'](http://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/documents/resources/commute_travel_product.pdf) figures, we can crudely estimate that a 6000 mi flight * .185 kg / passenger-mi results in over one metric ton of direct CO2 emissions&amp;nbsp;— roughly 10% of the average American's direct transportation emissions&amp;nbsp;— not insignificant.&#xD;&#xA; - What will your daily commute look like?  If you're staying at home wiping the grand kids' ass then score some points for sustainability!  However, if you are going to need to drive your car for entertainment, volunteering, work in either situation, you'll need to exploit opportunities to carpool or use a low emission vehicle (think electric with solar).&#xD;&#xA; - What will the building situation look like?  If you can't directly compare electric and heating bills, consider the natural lighting, the climate (a more extreme climate leads to increased HVAC loads), insulation and air leakiness of the house.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now more specific to your question, let's hold these factors constant and just consider how adding an additional person to a house can contribute to sustainability.  Every four years the EIA conducts a [residential energy consumer survey](http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption#summary).  Now here is some data I love and think would be very interesting to you  (there is a bunch of other great stuff in there for any data junkies):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are substantial energy savings from increasing the number of members per household. However *there are diminishing returns* to adding another member to the house.  So the first person would contribute 30% per capita energy savings, the second 20%, the third 10%.  This is important from a macro-perspective.  Let's say you have 30 people and developers are considering design occupancy.  The improvement from going from six 5-person units to five 6-person units is not as significant as moving from fifteen 2-person units to ten 3-person units.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From your perspective as an individual (or couple), there will be significant advantages to living in 5+ person house compared to a house for one or two people.  Let's say you are considering a two person house vs a six person house.  Moving into the two person house, you would be responsible for 50% of the 2-person house's primary energy (45 MBtu).  If you were the sixth person in a five person house, you would be responsible for 4MBtu margin of going from 5 person to six person house.  **A huge difference!**  These gains are mostly from shared energy sources, such as a refrigerator, shared lighting, shared air temperature etc.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Obviously energy consumption is very different outside US, but the principles should hold. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ipXsv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/blWi7.png" />

Most of the complications come from your interpretation of *sustainable*.  Let me give you a quick summary and explain why it isn't enough:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fiberglass** insulation is the most common these days.  It is easy to install.  However, it is not healthy to breath, so the installer must wear protection to avoid contact with skin and inhalation.  It has higher embodied energy than cellulose [(970 MJ/m^3)](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/cbpr/documents/pdfs/ee-coefficients.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Blown Cellulose (dry)** insulation is not as common these days since it settles.  This causes the top of the wall over time to become not insulated at all.  For a diligent home owner, and depending on how the wall was constructed, this can be fixed by periodically adding insulation from the top of the wall.  However, this problem is harder to deal with when there is compaction under windows and other places where it is hard to access later.  It has lower embodied energy than fiberglass [(112 MJ/m^3)](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/cbpr/documents/pdfs/ee-coefficients.pdf).  This can easily be used in attics where settling isn't much of a concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wet Cellulose (wet)** insulation is very similar to blown cellulose except that it is blown in wet so that it binds to whatever it hits and doesn't settle over time.  This is fairly standard, but can only be around 4&quot; thick before you have to start embedding some plastic or other support to help hold up the insulation.  It is string enough to not sag, but not when spanning large gaps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Styrofoam** insulation is often used under foundations, but also in walls.  It is strong and easy to install, but the manufacture still creates many [harmful chemicals](http://www.earthresource.org/campaigns/capp/capp-styrofoam.html), to both those manufacturing it and the general air quality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Rice Hulls** can be used in a similar was as blown cellulose and has similar problems.  It can settle, though I haven't been able to find anyone saying how much they settle.  It is also an agricultural waste product.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Spray Foam** is often used to fill in lots of gaps and is great for sealing your walls.  A lot of heat is lost through tiny cracks in walls, around windows, etc.  Spray foam in these places can be especially helpful.  There are many spray foams available, some claiming to be 'green,' which one is most sustainable could be its own question.  Most spray foam is toxic enough that there are warnings on the label saying you shouldn't let it touch your skin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sawdust** was used a long time ago, but has since been replaced by blown cellulose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Trade Offs**&#xD;&#xA;Do you consider small amounts of ozone 'unsustainable?'  What are the trade-offs between ozone depletion and embodied energy (styrofoam vs fiberglass)?  What are local labor costs?  If one insulation takes twice as long to install, perhaps you'd have been better off installing the easy/cheap one, and putting the rest of the money in solar panels, organic food or any number of other places.  Extra thick walls to support extra insulation will (depending on your wall construction method) require extra wall material (wider studs in a framed wall).  That could also be factored in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Thermal Mass**&#xD;&#xA;Another thing to consider is thermal mass.  It is helpful to have things like concrete, earth, brick and water inside (or a part of your inside wall).  This is most helpful in places which have large temperature swings.  In these places if it is 70 during the day and 20 at night, your thermal mass can hold your house at daytime temperatures all night, without having to turn on the heat (and visa-versa in the summer with cool nights).  In places where the swings are less, thermal mass is less important, though still helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Air Tight**&#xD;&#xA;Even if you have highly insulated walls, small gaps which let outside air inside and visa-versa can have a huge impact on heating/cooling bills.  Some insulation types are better at preventing these kinds of gaps than others." />

Your question addresses exactly what the ecological footprint does not measure, and the question you link to is trying to explain that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fundamentally, ecological footprint is about energy. Sunlight arrives and is used by plants (or a tiny amount is used directly by people via PV or other solar power systems), which use it to convert CO2 out of the air into more complex carbon molecules. So you can take a complicated cycle like &quot;plants plus time to coal, coal plus iron to steel becomes car&quot; and work backwards to say that the car took X amount of coal, or X amount of energy, to make.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As the Ecological Footprint measures the area required to produce a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; material or absorb carbon dioxide emissions, materials such as mercury&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that are not created by biological processes nor absorbed by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; biological systems do not have a defined Ecological Footprint&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To use aluminium as you do, what they're saying is that aluminium as a metal does not have an ecological footprint, since nothing in the earthly environment makes aluminium. We have a finite supply of aluminium-containing rocks that we can refine the metal out of. Aluminium is not really a good example, since it's very common and not very toxic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's no direct ecological process that takes aluminium out of the environment. Nothing eats it, in other words. What happens is that it eventually oxidises and breaks up, forming inert compounds, in other words sand/rocks. This is perhaps most obvious with iron/steel, where parts of the world have naturally occurring iron ore right on the surface. In a lot of Western Australia they call it &quot;dirt&quot;, because the soil is 99% iron ore. It's called haematite as a rock, or rust if you see it on an iron object. That cycle is fairly obvious: take rust (haematite), heat it and remove the oxygen and you get iron. Expose iron to air and water and it breaks back down to rust. Most chemicals have more complex pathways and are often toxic through the whole pathway - dioxins and plutonium, for example, take a very long time to break down and are nasty at almost every step. And there's really no way to express that in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What the ecological footprint can measure is the cost of finding aluminium ore (rocks), and turning those into useful aluminium metal objects. Or recycling them, or immobilising them to make them less poisonous. In essence, the processes are only about energy, and energy is relatively easy to express in carbon footprint terms." />

I live in appartment city, Tallinn in Estonia where since 2005 compost container was mandatory in front of every block of flats. Waste sorting is what you need in New York. I use a pretty small separate compost container, wrapped with a thin disposable plastic bags in the flat and carry the bag over into the public container once a while. I do not buy the plastic bags. They are given for free in our all-about-packaging economy when buy the fruits or vegetables. It is thin and mandatorily disposable since 2005 in Estonia. And it does not smell because what I compost is mostly vegetable rather than animal organics and vegan diet does not smell at all (neither as compost nor when you fart). There are other containers plastic/metal packaging, glass and paper. These do not smell at all. The food packaging could but you rinse them to avoid smell and improve the quality of the recicling materials that you deliver. We should also reduce the amount of detergents when washing anything so that we could safely head the sewage on our crop fields. I mean that liquid fraction should also be composted efficiently but our owners head us to poison the waters with their products.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Otherwise, if you want everything to do individually, as consumerist, why do you care about resource conservation and don't you want to grow the electricity by your personal generator?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_sorting&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/2398/476" />

A ship gets 1 tonne of lift for every cubic metre of water it displaces, while a helium airship gets about [1kg per cubic metre][5]. So roughly speaking an airship will have a thousand times the volume of an equivalent water ship (at this level we can assume both ships have no mass).

Both airship and water ship designers work quite hard to stay in this zone. [Wikipedia has a list][6], with air typically about 18μPa.s and water 1000 μPa.s (50x as high). Since the airship is 1000x the volume it'll be about 10x as large in each dimension. Drag here is determined by frontal area (basically, how much fluid has to be shoved out of the way) so the airship has 100x the frontal area and 100x the drag, but air is only 1/50th the viscosity. Overall, the airship faces twice the drag of the water ship.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fluid Movement**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a global scale air moves less predictably than water, and faster.

So airships need to be docked inside a hangar. A [really, really big hangar][7]. Or they need to be semi-rigid so they can land, deflate, and park in a smaller hangar.

Even if the dock is just a post with a rope in the middle of a circular clearing, the airship is 10x as long so the clearing has to be 100x as large. For temporary sites, the airship can hover and winch things down. Similarly, a water ship can use a crane to unload itself. Water ships generally don't do this because they carry so much more than an airship does (a &quot;medium sized&quot; water ship might carry [100,000 tonnes of cargo][8]) while a really [big airship carries 160 tonnes][9] - note the absent &quot;000&quot; on the second number).

A large fixed wing aircraft can carry about 300 tonnes for 15,000 kilometres, where the high end for watercraft is 120,000 tonnes for 20,000 kilometres (and the energy cost is at least a thousand times lower).

If you personally can't fix it (or **have it fixed** somewhere cheaply), only then I'd recommend giving the laptop (when **really** broken) to a recycle centre or the like (e.g., in my country the electronics shops are required to collect and responsibly recycle electronic devices, free of charge for customers). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I *hope*, these centralized methods of recycling provide a better way to recycle laptops than what you can personally do (at least, after you uninstall memory sticks and HDD, remove the battery and CMOS battery)..." />

Seymours five acre plan includes grazing and hey pastures, barley, beets and carrots for animal fodder, some woodland, a large vegetable garden, lots of beans and so forth.

In Australia the main use of small battery-backed solar systems is for off-grid locations but people are increasingly looking at going off-grid as the cost of the grid keeps rising (mostly due to cheap air-conditioners) while the cost of PV systems drops. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're trying to reduce your total environmental impact the calculations become much more complex because you need to first decide what counts as &quot;environmental impact&quot; and how you're going to compare different sorts ([see this question, for example][1]), then for each option work out what the impact actually is. I'm going to assume you're just using money as your measure since the method is the same but the process is simpler. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To do the calculations you really must know not just how much electricity you use, but how much of that use can be eliminated, reduced, substituted or time-shifted. The value proposition for all of those changes when you're looking at off-grid power because of the cost of generating and storing it. You can get extremely efficient fridges, for example, but they're expensive. But off-grid the reduction in power consumption is often cheaper than generating the extra power using PV and storing it in batteries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sort of battery technology used for houses hasn't changed significantly in the last 20 years, it's still lead-acid based. There are a few lithium battery systems just starting to enter the market now, but if you are not happy with lead-acid batteries I would not suggest buying a lithium one until that market matures. It's still very &quot;version one&quot; right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to save money and reduce your environmental impact is to reuse materials. If you're in an urban area you may be able to get &quot;ready to recycle&quot; lead-acid traction batteries, for example, that no longer work in their original application but are fine for you (an electric forklift that only runs for half a day is effectively useless, but a 50kWh rated battery that's down to 20kWh actual capacity is excellent value for $500). Similarly, buying second hand panels and supports might save you money and significantly reduce your environmental impact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since you're in Australia I suggest you join the [Alternative Technology Association][2] and read the relevant issues of their Renew magazine as this the viability of opting off the grid has been discussed recently. They've been talking about off-grid power system in Australia since they were founded (20-odd years IIRC).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/2396/accounting-for-ecological-foot-print-of-non-renewable-resources&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://ata.org.au" />

If it's moist food that's easy for them to munch on that's not a problem but if it's a cracker or a piece of green wood (just trying to make a point) you're going to need some decomposition time for worms to be able to work with it.

If a tray is full you just start placing food in an empty tray above. The material in the new tray will decompose and turn into soil eventually.

If you wait a bit longer all eggs in the lower tray will have hatched, so the baby worms can move to the top as well and you can start harvesting vermicompost from the bottom tray. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that tray systems work well with the most-used and popular [Eisenia Fetida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenia_fetida) worms that like to live just below the surface so tend to crawl up, but less well with other species like [Eisenia Hortensis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_nightcrawler) that tend to crawl all over the place. &#xD;&#xA;" />

First microorganisms need to soften the food and start decomposing it, only then will the worms eat it. Most people don't care much about how fast food is processed and simply dump it on top of the bin. This will work fine, but there are two things you can do to speed up the decomposition process:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Chop up the food in smaller pieces. Some people even blend the food into a puree, but personally I think that's a waste of energy.&#xD;&#xA;2. Create pockets or holes in the top layer and fill those with fresh food. The idea is that by using pockets, a larger surface of fresh food comes into contact with microbes already living in the bin and the material will decompose quicker (not sure if this have been scientifically proven).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Burying food is similar to creating pockets, but in this case more food is exposed to microbes so decomposition should be a bit faster even. However, if you bury food you may disturbe the worms and cause them stress which may slow decomposition down. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I don't like to bury food. I'm not sure how much worms will suffer from stress, but for me it is mainly because I'm not convinced it will speed things up much, plus I'm just don't care much about speed. Most of the time I just dump chopped food on top, but occasionally a create a few pockets with some top material and use those into they are full. The only time I will bury food is when I have a fruit fly infestation, but then I bury wet fresh material under dry fresh material (e.g.paper towels or cardboard)." />
