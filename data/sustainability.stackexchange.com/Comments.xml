Regenerative braking is **the** reason that hybrids get better fuel economy (about 25-30%) than the same model without the hybrid package.  All cars lose energy from tires and wind drag, not just hybrids.  Hybrids are more efficient because at low speeds (city driving), that's when you're using the brakes, and regenerating (recovering) energy.  At 60 mph, you're not using the brakes much, and thus, you get no fuel economy boost vs. a non-hybrid." CreationDate="2013-04-22T07:31:37.450" UserId="486" />

Another variable in factoring the comparison would be the energy source that charges the car in the case of plug ins.  Is it being charged by gas, nuclear, or coal plant?  All have their draw backs.
