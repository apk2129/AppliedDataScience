Some impact categories to think about: carbon footprint/global warming potential, energy consumption, ecotoxicity, human health, water consumption. All of these are pretty commonly used. There is a lot of research on LCA methods, both on how to collect the basic data and how to transform it into these impact categories. Two common methods include the EPA's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html&quot;&gt;TRACI&lt;/a&gt; or the european &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lcia-recipe.net/&quot;&gt;ReCiPe&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally, LCA's provide a quantitative and clear answer, but that's rarely true - they are quantitative though, which is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some of your later questions, particularly around batteries, the answers will depend on the study. The technical terms here are allocation and boundary conditions. Do we model battery recycling? who gets the benefits of it? what technologies are we looking at, and what other products do those produce? What impacts or processes do we include or exclude? There are generally a lot of assumptions, which need to be made and defended to move forward - though often they need to be revised for new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your initial question, there was a poorly done report from years ago that purported to show that older Priuses were 'worse' than a Hummer in terms of energy usage. The report was &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2007/08/27/201795/prius-easily-beats-hummer-in-life-cycle-energy-use-dust-to-dust-report-has-no-basis-in-fact/?mobile=nc&quot;&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt; all over the place, but it is true that we've gotten better at making batteries over time. New hybrids have much lower impacts than the originals, and keeping the car longer will definitely decrease the relative impact (one of the assumptions is about how long cars last). Check out a newer study &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702178s&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Or make arrangements so that a larger animal (e.g. in the case where you're keeping dairy animals like goats or cattle) can be shared among enough people so that the meat is used immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Canning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's energy intensive up-front, but meat can be home canned and preserved for extended periods of time (possibly longer than salting, smoking, or drying).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canning meat requires a bit of investment in equipment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pressure canner (~$80)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;jars, lids, and rings (~$15 per dozen quart jar kit)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a few misc. tools (e.g. jar lifter)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the canner, jars, rings, and tools can be reused many times so that the cost per batch ends up very low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can get detailed instructions for home canning meat in trusted books like the &quot;Ball Blue Book&quot; or from the US &lt;a href=&quot;http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can5_meat.html&quot;&gt;National Center for Home Food Preservation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the canning is done, all you have to do is keep the product in a relatively cool, dark, dry place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="66" LastEditorUserId="66" LastEditDate="2013-02-01T02:52:04.243" LastActivityDate="2013-02-01T02:52:04.243" CommentCount="7" />

While a single bathroom sink may not have enough overall drainage to supply a single toilet with adequate quantities of water, the grey cistern will have a much greater chance of meeting the demand. This will leave you with only black water drains entering the septic/sewage system, thereby providing use of the same water twice before discarding, and as such greatly reducing your water usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may (should?) be able to collect more in the grey water cistern than is needed to provide a supply for your toilet needs.

You might also be interested in researching 'Humanure' while you are at it, as a way to recycle the black water drains as well, providing a possible third use of the same water; as well as increasing food production, and further reducing septic/sewage load.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other things to consider are the possible impact of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fecal matter reaching the grey water, e.g. cloth diapers in the washing machine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Urine reaching the grey water, e.g. urinating in the shower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cleaning products in the grey water, and their affect on plant life, if using to water the lawn/garden.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="86" LastActivityDate="2013-01-30T10:56:53.320" />

But the actual calculation of such values is very complex and always comes along with a lot of research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned the example of trains (Deutsche Bahn).

At first thought, the snow is cold so how could it keep one warm. The true value is in the insulation. The design creates a small insulating shelter. The cold weather stays out, the body heat stays in. This is part of the reason they are built small, like tents. The small volume is easier to heat by residual body temperature alone. The more people in the structure, the quicker and warmer it will become.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The human body averages 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37°C), the reason for hypothermia is the environment is sapping too much of that heat energy away from the body. By creating an igloo or similar structure, it is possible to prevent the body heat from moving too far away. As the body releases heat energy, it becomes trapped in the igloo by the thick snow walls, and builds up. The interior will not reach 98.6, but it is possible to raise it to a much more comfortable temperature than the frigid outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing to remember with igloos is that they are cut down into the snow pack, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; built on top of it. This allows a smaller surface area presented to the outer environment. Also, the orientation of the door must be taken into consideration. Allowing the cold wind to drive right in through the door is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, the snow itself will still be cold to the touch. Proper clothing is essential, the igloo just helps to maintain an environment with a higher ambient air temperature, thereby slowing the rate of heat loss from the human body.

Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be closely connected with the basic orientation of the culture. For example in ancient Egypt, the biggest goal was to &quot;live forever&quot; - their growth aimed to produce tomb treasures, which could be looted and reused in bad times. There are theories that people could legally loot their ancestors' tombs if the ancestors didn't bless them and protect them - the dead (and especially dead kings) were believed to have power to ensure blessing of good crops and of freedom from enemies. Whether these theories are true or not is a question for History.SE, the conclusion is that such civilisation was oriented for long term survival, not for temporary growth and that it survived thousands of years, at least three big crises and many smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were many cultures even more oriented for growth than our civilisation - they were mostly war-like states, like most of Dark Age kingdoms. Constant war, winning, loot and new vassals were requirements of their existence, so few such states survived, and many ceased to exist in few years, with just few major defeats. The culture survived the end of such states, but it couldn't stay long in with such orientation on military expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our civilisation is more similar to the Dark Age than to ancient Egypt, but of course better - it's oriented on economic and technological growth, which are more resistant to temporary failures than military expansion. But not so much - recent economic crisis shows it's drawback. And there are ecological challenges, oil peak and so on. Existence of this forum shows that there are people who try to make the civilisation sustainable, but the idea that we don't need reserves, because technological growth will solve everything decreases flexibility of our civilisation. How shall we survive the moment of opening eyes and seeing that oil is too rare to be cheap, and that other sources are too expensive for our &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potlatch&quot;&gt;potlatch&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, economic growth can be sustainable, but &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) must be slower&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) must be backed up by better reserves for bad times&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;c) must not be a basic aim of the civilisation, since orientation to growth is in conflict with flexibility and willingness to decrease my consumption for the good of the whole. This is a matter of values - if most people are egoists who would rather accept risk of collapse of civilisation later than to decrease standard of living now, than growth is not sustainable and will eventually lead to disaster, but with certain minimal percentage of altruists willing to decrease their ecological footprint, even groth can be sustainable.

A sustainable system is closed in the sense that you need to buy as few resources as possible and produce as little waste as possible. Your system just keeps turning, like a perpetual motion machine, with you feeding off the system. Composting your waste is a way to reintroduce it into your system and &quot;closing the loop&quot; so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case you are not part of a self-sufficient sustainable system. All you can do to live more sustainably is take measures to have as little negative impact on the system as you can, that is reduce the number of things you need to buy and reduce your waste (or give out your waste in a way for the system to make it reusable, which you do by separating your trash). A direct way to control your impact on the system is to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Reduce your requirements for input and reduce your wasteful output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, there are many people who use their balcony as garden, be that just herbs, vegetables (like runner beans on poles, potatoes) or bees. To overcome the climate conditions, you could consider turning your balcony into a greenhouse by adding a layer of glass, which in itself would reduce your input (gas/electricity for your heating) and reduce your wasteful output (CO2 emitted for generating the heat). Again, a balcony vegetable garden would reduce input (groceries, new plastic bags) and wasteful output (used plastic bags, CO2 emissions from the supermarket trucks, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composting makes most sense when you use the compost yourself, but even if you do not use it yourself, your gardening neighbour would probably be happy to receive good compost, or even just good food waste. This way you make sure that your food waste doesn't just get burned, which would be a real shame. Food waste is so close to being something so useful...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compost is useful where something grows, be that lush foliage, or just shrubs.

The fact is that cultures, languages, and economies are constantly changing.  Because an economy is always changing we have to be careful regarding definitions of sustainable.

A mother is not genetically identical to the daughter it produces, and every mother is not identical to all other mothers. The organisms in your scoby (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) affect how the fermented tea will taste, so you will always have variety. They also adapt, so if you are using a specific kind of tea for a long time, the daughters produced will start to adapt to the environment and perhaps be better tasting, or maybe not. If you really like the way your friend's tea tastes, you should get a daughter from them and if you like how the tea you make tastes, you should always keep the mother and give away the daughters or compost them or keep them as back up, whatever you choose.

Your competitors do, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using these two advantages, you can change fresh food into something that, at least for the period of preservation, is not edible by your competitors, but edible by you, once you choose to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The true art of preserving food is, however, not to overdo it (because it will not taste as good) and not &quot;underdo&quot; it (or your competitors, the bugs, moulds, etc. will eat it first). You need to get it &quot;just right&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, when preparing preserved food, you should ask yourself for what period you would like to preserve it and under which conditions you will store it (humidity and temperature are the biggest factors). Then taking into account discrepancies in your calculation, you preserve your food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Salting is very good and doesn't vary so much with humidity. It rather varies with length of preservation and temperature of storage place. A cool place slows down the process of your food being &quot;eaten&quot; by someone else. For Japanese pickled plums (umeboshi) I have the figures in my head:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;7% salt: 1 year in the fridge&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;12-15% salt: 1 year at room temperature (up to 30, 35 degrees in the summer)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;20%+ salt: indefinitely at room temperature (7 year umeboshi are quite a delicacy)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plums are dried in the sun for several days, several hours per day before salting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I presume similar measures apply to meat. These plums are extremely salty though. You can't really take more than 1 small plum per meal. If you decide to dry and salt your meat, you have to decide how you want to eat it in the end. A big salt-preserved steak won't taste very good...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar ideas apply to smoking and drying. Be sure how you want to eat your preserved meat, for how long you want (or need) to preserve it and then by frugal with your preservation methods.

With respect to mulch in the summer, it would make sense to put the used bedding to service as mulch -- it will carry along a bit of extra nutrient enrichment. (Of course, being careful not to use it around crops that would come into contact with manures like spinach or lettuce.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My choices for bedding would include straw, wood shavings, sawdust, hay, and dry leaves -- depending on the needs of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With any of these, if you are going to DIY, you can make a place to store the finished product until it is ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the cheapest and possibly the easiest: dry leaves. You might be able to acquire a large quantity of leaves for free. Do you live in a place where people rake up the leaves on their lawns and leave them in bags at the curb? If so, round up a bunch of bags when they're in season and store them for use as bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you live, you might be able to find wood byproducts from a mill for cheap or free -- you'd just have to find a way to transport them to your house. Unfortunately arborist wood chips, which can sometimes be had for free by asking a passing tree truck, are too coarse for animal bedding -- though they do make for nice mulch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could try growing your own straw. I believe you're in Australia's hardiness zone 4, so your winter lows are about 0°C? You could set aside a portion of your yard to growing a grain crop for straw. An appropriate choice might even be something you could grow as a cover crop during your mild winter. With some planning and luck maybe you could even get a triple yield and harvest some grain for use as animal feed or for your own use. (But at least save enough grain so that you have seed for the next crop!) The downside here is the amount of space required, the low straw yield you'll probably get, and the amount of manual labor required to process it. At your scale a scythe is a reasonable way to harvest the crop; I'm guessing that machinery isn't practical in your setting (e.g. hiring someone to come and process 700m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; seems very unlikely). The straw also won't be compacted like machine made bales, so it will take up more space in storage, and may be more prone to taking up moisture if you live in a humid climate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly you could try planting your yard to a hay crop. This has the benefit over straw of being perennial. It may be harder to process -- grass is wetter and will take longer to dry. It is also heavier to handle. I'm not a fan of hay for mulch since it is full of seeds and often carries weeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to do it yourself, but want to avoid going to a store, ask around to find farmers in your area who may be willing to sell you what you need. You may be able to get it cheaper or more conveniently if you have the storage at your house to buy a bulk amount.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can usually save money if you pick up the hay &quot;out of the field&quot; instead of after the farmer has done the work of transporting it and stacking it in his barn. This takes some coordination with the farmer so that you know exactly when the hay is being harvested, and being flexible with your schedule to go and pick it up immediately. (I do this, and it sometimes requires clearing my schedule for an afternoon so that I can go pick up hay and stack it in my barn.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a final note: you will probably end up wanting to combine some of these. E.g. build a storage shed, get dry leaves off your neighbors' curbs when you can, plant a stand of buff oats for straw and as a cover crop, and find someone nearby who can supply you with enough hay to fill those months where you have gaps in your homegrown supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="66" LastActivityDate="2013-02-01T03:48:42.753" />

Compost is a key ingredient in organic farming. At the simplest level, the process of composting simply requires making a heap of wetted organic matter (leaves, &quot;green&quot; food waste) and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of weeks or months. Modern, methodical composting is a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture. Worms and fungi further break up the material. Aerobic bacteria manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium. The ammonium is further converted by bacteria into plant-nourishing nitrites and nitrates through the process of nitrification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For composting with worms see &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/vermicomposting&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'vermicomposting'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;vermicomposting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20" LastEditorUserId="99" LastEditDate="2013-06-25T08:21:16.190" LastActivityDate="2013-06-25T08:21:16.190" />

The chimney is insulated and gets very hot, which helps burn more of the gases of combustion, producing more heat from the same fuel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cooking pot sits directly over the chimney, so the hot exhaust hits it directly. You can also add a skirt around the pot, so the exhaust gas is held close to the sides of the pot, further improving heat transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To create a functioning rocket stove, you need an insulated J-shaped chimney.

This will create turbulence that will mix the gases and air for better combustion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have to get the chimney hot to make it work. One way is to light the fire &lt;em&gt;in the chimney&lt;/em&gt;, then start adding fuel the regular way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use just about any found materials that can tolerate the heat and provide insulation where needed.

I am in the camp which says they are provided the changes are not huge (going from highly alkaline soil to very acidic) and so I assume your pines are part of this effort.  I have been looking at trying to do something similar in a similar zone but haven't got the blueberries in yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some outstanding questions in my mind which include how some of these plants affect soil pH.....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple observations....  A major part of the allelopathy of conifers seems to be nitrogen depletion.  Conifer needles fall when they are brown, they form a very loose mulch which composts slowly in the absence of a lot of nitrogen.  This creates physical and nutritional barriers to other plants around the trees even before taking into account toxins.  While this is not based so much on observing pines, I have a 100 yr old sitka spruce and this effect here is quite easily noticeable.  Shallowly rooted plants can't get much of a foothold because of the very low density, low nitrogen, low water needle layer at the top.  My thinking is you are going to have to be doing a lot of additional mulching and composting to make up for this effect.  This is not going to be the ideal happy guild that folks go for and is going to be comparatively labor-intensive by permacultural standards.  The composting and mulching will likely help with allelopathic toxins too but given the level of composting required I think nitrogen fixers will be relatively secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So on to specific recommendations, I have noticed the following plants seeming to do ok around my sitka spruce that are nitrogen fixers:  white clover and russian olive.  A lot of deciduous trees however raise soil pH so I don't know what impact the russian olive might have there.  Also my soil is not quite the same as yours (mildly alkaline in most places, but it varies quite a bit across my yard for various reasons including historic uses, but I am assuming it is mildly acidic where these plants are growing because of the spruce).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more thing that occurs to me is that the research I have seen on trees and soil pH is that trees become less efficient at changing pH as they get older.

Let's look at the issues one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Condensation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you only open the secondary glazing when the inside air is cool and dry that will reduce the chances of condensation. Put some dessicant in the gap, and dry it out occasionally, if you like. The specific risk of condensation will depend on the temperature and humidity when you open the secondary window, and the temperature to which the air gap subsequently drops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The building of the secondary frame, and clearance for opening, will determine the air gap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't fit it to the existing frame: have it in its own frame. The hinges on your double glazing aren't designed to handle the extra weight of another sheet of glass, and you won't get a good seal around the new pane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Place the secondary glazing inside: your existing double glazing is already weather-proof. Your secondary glazing needn't be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Energy savings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You've already got most of the energy savings that you're going to get, from the double-glazing. And they probably came as much from the improved air-tightness, as from the decreased U-value. With secondary glazing, you'll only have savings from additional U-value decreases. Here's the calculation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combined U-value = 1 /  [ (1 / secondary-glazing U-value) + (1 / double-glazing U-Value) ]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if your secondary glazing would have a U-value of 2.0, and your double-glazing has a U-Value of 1.0, then the combined U-value = 1 / (1/2.0 + 1/1.0) = 1 / 1.5 = 0.67. So you'd reduce the window losses (not total losses, just losses through the window) by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's unlikely to be economic, on energy savings alone, unless your unit cost of heat energy is immense, and/or it gets to -20&amp;deg;C outside for a few weeks a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;But then there's comfort&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if you currently find that sitting right under the window is uncomfortable because of cool down-draughts, then the effective increase in usable room space you get from the secondary triple-glazing might make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;And taking it to the extreme&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the place is already super-insulated all over &lt;strong&gt;except&lt;/strong&gt; the window, and you get lots of sun in in winter, and you've already installed an &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/241/48&quot;&gt;MVHR&lt;/a&gt;, then adding secondary triple-glazing might be the thing that effectively turns your home into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm&quot;&gt;Passivhaus&lt;/a&gt;.

We resubmit your data broker opt-outs on a&#xA;  regular basis to ensure your name and address stay off the lists being&#xA;  shared. We will also continue to add new data brokers to our lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are other options you can do yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Direct Marketing Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to cut out a lot of the junk mail coming to your house in one blow, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) is the way to go. It's not a federal program like the Do Not Call Registry but most reputable direct marketers belong to the DMA, and they offer an opt-out service to you, the consumer. You fill out a form with the DMA, then they compile a list of those who do not wish to receive unsolicited mail and send it to client companies who order these lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to register with the DMA's opt-out service: you can simply send a post card with your name and address to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mail Preference Service&#xA;Direct Marketing Association&#xA;PO Box 643&#xA;Carmel, NY 10512&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your name will be added to the list. However this can take about a month to process with the DMA, as well as time for it to feed out to their client organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a form provided on their web site that you can fill out and mail in to the same address as above. Filling out the form online gives it a unique tracking number that enables them to process the request faster than if you just send in a post card.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly you can fill out the online form and submit it online. This processes your application immediately and should result in the flow of junk mail slowing within a period of about 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out more about the DMA's Mail Preference Service check out their web site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmaconsumers.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.dmaconsumers.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt-out of Junk Mail With Individual Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not every company works in conjunction with the DMA's Mail Preference Service that allows for mass opt-out. However, many companies do provide forms to fill out so that you don't appear in the lists for their junk mail or to have your address distributed by them. Even if they don't have forms or a proper method in place you can still contact them either through their web site, snail mail or calling customer service and get something sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the idea that we, the consumer, should have to go the extra mile in order to ensure that our names and addresses are not sold from here to Timbuktu and that we not receive unsolicited mail is ridiculous, but unfortunately it is also a fact of life. At least until tougher laws are passed and tighter regulations enforced on the direct marketing industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The place to start individual opting out are businesses that you are in regular contact with. Your bank is a prime target. Also anytime a store asks you for your name and address, ask them what they do with the information and what you need to do to make sure it is not used to send junk mail to your house. Opt-out before they even have a chance to opt you in involuntarily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of what I am talking about: in the summer of 2005 I went to a major furniture chain to purchase a freezer. When I made the purchase, they wanted information such as my name and address. I asked them what they would be using the information for and reluctantly they told me it would be used to send solicitations from them to my house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I told them I did not want any junk mail coming to my house. They said ok, and before I left I fill out a three page form saying that I wanted no unsolicited mail from them coming to my house. All well and good, or so I thought. Then, a couple of months later they sent me a flyer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I called them, quite upset. After all the trouble I had gone through to fill out the forms so I would get no mail, I still got it in my mailbox. After some arguing with the manager I got him to take my name off the list, and since then I have not received any junk mail from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt-out Telephone Numbers and Addresses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here now we will look at contact information for a few businesses that engage in direct marketing. One of the worst types of junk mail are the constant credit card applications coming every day. These junk mailings are for the most part the work of three companies: Experian, Trans Union and Equifax, the big three credit reporting companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three companies are the ones responsible for compiling all of the data that goes into creating your credit score. They are also to blame for the majority of credit card applications sent to your house. If you want these to stop, there is one simple telephone number you can call:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1-888-5OPTOUT or 1-888-567-8688&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will stop you from receiving junk mail from any of the big three credit reporting companies and should also stop the majority of the credit card applications coming your way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below are the addresses of many of the worst culprits in sending junk mail.

The next step is to pound the retted stems until the fibers are separate, and then spin them into twine.

The typical area I've seen quoted to fully sustain a family of four is about two acres.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the space required to be nearly self sufficient, including electricity, animals, and grains.  But most of that space is taken up by the veggies.  Of course, that is to supply the veggies for a whole year. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To supply the veggies for just the winter months depends on how long your winter is.  The 7 month long upstate New York winter I use to have to deal with is a totally different ball game than the 3-4 month southern Indiana winter I have now.  If we assume a decent winter of about 4 months and extrapolate from the graphic below, you'd need about 25,000 sq ft of green house to feed a family of four veggies through the winter.  That number probably varies depending on what, exactly you plant and how you make use of vertical space.  Also, how much veggies you eat (I think that number assumes a completely vegetarian diet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, in order to heat enough space, your best bet is probably to use row covers of heavy transparent plastic over your normal garden, rather than using a green house.  Lay in a fall crop of cold tolerant plants, and then build the row covers over the top of them.  Row covers are comparatively cheap to build and maintain.  They don't have to be anything more than hoops made of small diameter pvc pipe or steel re-bar with transparent plastic over them.  If you're somewhere with heavy snow, re-bar is probably the better choice.  As is a heavy plastic.  If your winter is light, you can probably get away with the pvc and a lighter weight plastic.  You can bury the edges a little, or cover them with mulch and stones to prevent them from blowing away in the wind.  Again, take into consideration just how rough the weather is likely to get. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another alternative is to use cold frames, wooden boxes with glass tops generally facing south.  These are generally harder to get a lot of area with than row covers, but they are very cheap and quick to build and pretty effective.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a semi decent run down of the types of row covers: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/row-covers?page=0,0&quot;&gt;http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/row-covers?page=0,0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the info graphic that 2 acres number comes from:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKDTp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Space to be completely self sufficient&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21" LastEditorUserId="21" LastEditDate="2013-02-08T01:46:51.593" LastActivityDate="2013-02-08T01:46:51.593" CommentCount="4" />

In theory, you could use a number of different models (e.g. the infographic in Daniel Bingham's answer, John Jeavon's &quot;How to Grow More Vegetables&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/1433/51&quot;&gt;etc&lt;/a&gt;). You'll get a wide variety of answers, and a lot depends on your specific circumstances -- and will likely vary widely for you from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that a limiting factor may not be so much the &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;, but the fact that the plants get fewer hours of sunlight in the winter as you move to higher latitudes, so they're not growing as much in the winter. Eliot Coleman talks about this in some of his books. One strategy you can use if this is an issue is to start your plants that will be harvested during the winter in the late summer so that they can have enough time to grow before the short days of winter arrive; they will be dormant (i.e. not growing) at that point but still harvestable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think an appropriate strategy would be to start small and experiment to figure out what &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; right size is. Set up some hoops over your garden to protect a handful of different winter crops. Keep track of how much space you allocate, what you've planted, and how much you can harvest and eat. Use this information to scale up your winter protection, and possibly to make adjustments to your crop selection, management, and harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A complementary strategy would be to increase the size of your summer garden so that you can have vegetables preserved for winter use. Winter squash, potatoes, and onions all store easily, and many more vegetables can be stored for months if you can provide a proper storage facility. (Apples and other fruits too, if you take a food forest approach to gardening.) Even if you don't have a good root cellar, you can preserve many other foods in a variety of ways. If you're processing your own chickens when there's a lot of vegetables available, use them in vegetable-heavy soups. (It makes the meat stretch farther.) These soups can be canned and enjoyed all winter long. I keep bags of greens (kale, spinach, chard) in the freezer for use in recipes during the winter -- lasagna, soups, quiche, etc. If you don't like the energy used by a freezer, most of these can be dried effectively as well, and stored for long periods that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to put a number on it, let's say that you want to provide four 4oz salads (4oz of fresh greens only) a day for 6 months (October 1 through March 31). That's a pound a day for 180 days -- 180 pounds. A decent yield for spring-grown spinach would be about 1 pound per square foot, lettuce perhaps 2 lb/sqft. To make up a number, let's say you average about .5 lb/sqft for winter-harvested greens. You'd need a greenhouse with 360 square feet of &lt;strong&gt;growing space&lt;/strong&gt;, plus space for paths, whatever heating you are going to provide, and whatever else you might keep in the building. It's a fairly simple formula, so you can play with the numbers, but until you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what your numbers really are (i.e. the strategy above), it's just a guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I'm assuming greens above because they're among the easiest things for winter harvest, and to keep the answer simpler. Carrots and parsnips can be harvested in winter too as long as you keep the ground from freezing around them, but they don't need a greenhouse.

One just creates more solid pollution at end of life of the vehicle, the other creates more air pollution.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you noted the EGR makes that your engine runs less efficiently under throttle.  That results in wasted fuel and reduced power.  Meaning you have to consume more fuel to get the power you need.  The lab tests on this show favorable numbers for the EGR valve but in actual use someone driving in town accelerating fast from a stop can actually emit more pollutants.  Under preferred (read low power) acceleration from stop you get great improvement in either case but the EGR vehicle will emit less CO, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under the same amount of throttle, with a barely noticeable reduction in power.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern engines including your 2003 Jetta are computer controlled and require an active EGR to operate.

All biodiesel is not created equal. If you have a source of biodiesel recycled from used oil, the fuel refinement cost is practically nothing. If you are buying commercial biodiesel in the U.S., it is almost certainly made from soym and onventional soy farming is not sustainable.  Although, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usda.gov/oce/reports/energy/EnergyLifeCycleSoybeanBiodieseI6-11.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;most recent numbers from the USDA&lt;/a&gt; suggest that soy biodiesel is more efficient than before (thanks @Nate). Although the USDA has a clear bias (an interest in promoting aggriculture), I have no specific reason to think their numbers are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion, in order of least environmental impact (assuming you are using the most fuel-efficient vehicle in each class, that will suit your needs):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A bicycle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A used all-electric vehicle&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A used diesel vehicle, with recycled biodiesel or straight veg oil (SVO/WVO)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A used diesel vehicle, with standard diesel or soy biodiesel&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A used gasoline vehicle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A new all-electric vehicle&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A new diesel vehicle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A new gasoline vehicle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A used hybrid&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A new hybrid&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;I don't actually know if an all-electric vehicle is better than internal combustion, but I suspect it is, because it reduces the mass of the vehicle, and many peripheral fluids (engine coolant, motor oil, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;***&lt;/sup&gt;It's hard to rank hybrids accurately.  Some biased sources claim they are devilspawn. Other sources, biased in the other direction, claim they're heaven-sent. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  So take this absolute raking with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that even without biodiesel, a diesel vehicle is more sustainable than a gasoline vehicle.  All other things equal, diesel gets roughly 33% better fuel economy than gasoline per fuel volume.  Diesel refining is also, arguably, less harmful to the environment than gasoline.  And lastly, a diesel engine is mechanically simpler than a gasoline engine, and thus will last longer (500k miles is common).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest looking for a good quality used diesel vehicle.

If, however, it does not include consumption of the product and its direct consequences, then your system boundary is too small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For transport, we typically use a well-to-wheel basis. That's a generic description that applies even when the fuel doesn't come from a well (and even if the transport doesn't have wheels), and relates to the supply chain from initial extraction to the transport itself and the direct consequences, but not the indirect consequences such as changes in land use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Is the question meaningful?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neither petrol (gasoline) nor diesel are at all sustainable. Both score zero for sustainability. And there is little to choose between their unsustainability: the trade-offs being some increase in NOx and particulates, for some decrease in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both release carbon dioxide (and other pollutants) during combustion; and that is leading us to catastrophic climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both come from crude oil, which is a finite, depletable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extraction of crude oil itself is environmentally destructive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this means that the refining of each is environmentally unsustainable too: the production of each is unsustainable, along the entire supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the question, as posed, is not meaningful: it does not make any sense to ask about the sustainability of just the refining part of petrol (gasoline) or diesel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And given that the entire supply chain for each is unsustainable, it does not make any sense to talk about the relative sustainability of one part of that supply chain: sustainability by its very nature is an issue that concerns the whole system, not just one component.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;But which is worse?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://transact.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Camden%20LCA%20Report%20FINAL%2010%2003%202006.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Life Cycle Assessment of&#xA;Vehicle Fuels and Technologies (2006, London Borough of Camden)&lt;/a&gt;, diesel CO2 emissions are 16% lower than petrol on a life cycle basis (p36). However, particulate and NOx emissions from diesel are significantly worse (p37), with petrol NOx being only 60% of diesel NOx. Petrol has worse hydrocarbon emissions (p38). Those are on a unit-distance basis. Conversely, the unit-energy basis is used in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file14925.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UK DTI report from 2003, Life Cycle Assessment of Vehicle Fuels and Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, which gives total GHG emissions of 87gCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/MJ for ultra low sulphur diesel, and 81gCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/MJ for unleaded petrol (gasoline) (Table II).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary: there's really not much too choose between them.

This will vary from apartment to apartment.  Human ingenuity is a marvellous thing so I will not say it is impossible to practically re-use grey water but it sounds like a real challenge.  Note that not all apartments are the same and water re-use may take unusual forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a conventional graywater system a lot of different water sources are blended together and these have different properties.  Runoff from the shower is combined with runoff from the washing machine for example.  In your case I don't see how this could be made to work.  If you have your own laundry facilities, you might be able to come up with a way to harvest, for example, washing machine runoff, but it won't be quite the same thing but rather much more specific.  Consequently the question is if you get only a small portion of the gray water what then?  At any rate if you can modify the water out pipes from your laundry washing machine (dishwashers will be more complex due to space requirements) you might have a source of re-usable water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From that point the question is what you can do with it, since it is unlikely to be conventional gray water.  There may in fact be many uses possible.  I am not sure I would want to harvest water from the detergent-based laundry cycle and put on my plants, but the rinse cycle might be good for that.  The soap cycle however might be a useful bit of water you could use for washing recycling out or for other purposes and then discarded, essentially re-using both the detergent and the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastActivityDate="2013-02-12T01:10:26.563" />

Keep the warning above in mind, and make use of your greywater appropriately. A bit of planning in timing your water-generating and water-using activities might be helpful. (E.g. do laundry when you need to water plants.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Sources&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dish water&lt;/strong&gt; is controversial as a source of greywater -- I often see it categorized as blackwater. If you do your dishes by hand in a tub, then you don't have to worry about modifying any plumbing. Dish water may be categorized as blackwater because it will often contain grease, fat/oil, and food particles and you (a) don't really want to dump this on plants -- especially houseplants -- or (b) want to keep it hanging around for very long.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a &lt;strong&gt;washing machine&lt;/strong&gt; in your apartment, it should be easy to reconnect the outflow hose to a bucket. Just make sure (a) the bucket is big enough and (b) the hose is securely attached so that you don't make a mess! (Again, hopefully it's obvious, but if you're washing baby diapers then this is &lt;em&gt;blackwater&lt;/em&gt; -- don't keep it hanging around, flush it away.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the drain pipes connected to your &lt;strong&gt;sinks&lt;/strong&gt; are accessible, they are usually easy to disassemble (either unscrew or slide the pipes apart). You can put a bucket underneath, just be careful that it doesn't overflow. (The same note re: blackwater applies here if you're doing dishes by hand, or if you manage to disconnect the kitchen sink below a dishwasher outlet.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can't get to the sink pipes, consider placing a &lt;strong&gt;bowl in the sink&lt;/strong&gt; to catch water when you wash your hands.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Similarly, men can &lt;strong&gt;shave&lt;/strong&gt; with a bit of water in a bowl instead of letting the water go down the drain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I think taking a bath is probably a bigger water waster than taking a quick shower, so I don't think it's worth switching to baths just so you can reuse the water, but if you do take baths, you can scoop out most of the water with a pail before opening the drain. (You'll either need someplace to store it, or you'll have to be able to use it right away though. And if you have little ones in the house, don't keep a tub full of bath water hanging around!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Uses&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any extra water can be used for &lt;strong&gt;flushing&lt;/strong&gt;, but you should use the &quot;dirtiest&quot; water for this first since it is the last use that water will have. If you're storing the water in a bucket, you can just dump a gallon right into the bowl to flush.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you grab the &lt;strong&gt;soapy water&lt;/strong&gt; from the washing machine, you can use it for washing dirty stuff -- scrubbing the toilet bowl, cleaning out trash cans, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cleaner water can be used for &lt;strong&gt;watering plants&lt;/strong&gt;. Be careful about what you use for cleaning products, and you can probably use the water on more of your plants. Be careful about what water you use on plants that you're eating directly -- I don't think I'd use bath water on my spinach, for example.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a top-load washing machine, you could pour in some of your cleaner water into the &lt;strong&gt;initial rinse water&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you want to all-out, you can build a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tilz.tearfund.org/Publications/Footsteps+31-40/Footsteps+35/The+household+slow+sand+filter.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;slow sand filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -- even if you don't get the water back to fully potable, you can at least move it back up the cascade a stage or two, and/or allow it to be safely stored for longer periods.

It does not apply to vegetables or meat, or to cases where large amounts of sugar are not added.  If canning in those environment, please use more conservative approaches, or better yet from a sustainability perspective use more traditional means of preserving these foods for later, such as sauerkraut and salami.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fruit is not considered to be a particular risk when canning and if you go back a thousand years or so fruit preserved in sugar was stored open.  The acidity and sugar together combine to prevent harmful bacteria from growing, and white sugar is considered, at least by archaeologists, to be better at preserving fruit than honey is (see &quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot; by Ann Hagen).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally there are a few fruit which have fallen out of favor which are traditionally preserved with citrus added, most notably the quince (&quot;marmalade&quot; comes from a word meaning &quot;quince jelly&quot;).  If going outside of the common fruit used for such preserves, you may want to test pH (which may be a good idea anyway).  If in doubt, add some extra lemon juice or other acidic fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, even in the Middle Ages, such preserves were cooked, both before bottling and after bottling, so you can't omit the water bath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For fruit preserves, a pH of 4 gives you extra room in case the pH rises due to any number of factors.  Also note that fermented foods generally (that includes either lactic fermented foods like sauerkraut and alcoholic fermented foods like beer) are not botulism risks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more on safety, please see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/ill-intox/botu-eng.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/ill-intox/botu-eng.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/communicable/fact-sheets/botulism-food-borne.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/communicable/fact-sheets/botulism-food-borne.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always, defence in depth is important  and canning is a part of that depth today when making fruit preserves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old traditional method of sealing was to use wax.  There's no reason why a &quot;float&quot; of beeswax won't get you where you need to go along with jars which cannot themselves be sealed.  While this often works it is not perfect and the seal can break.  This being said there isn't any reason why this can't be used as one aspect of a seal.  It may not be perfect, but it is simple to do, and if the product is used within a few months, it is likely sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option, as you mention, is to re-use existing jam jars and lids.  I have done this with herbal medicine concoctions.  This usually works pretty well but some sorts of jars and lids I have learned to avoid not because they won't seal but because sometimes the seals end up locked and the jars impossible to open.  Jars to avoid include baby food jars.  I would assume that other similar jars should be avoided too.  Note you can test a seal with these by virtue of the fact that the button pops down.  If this doesn't happen, try a wax seal on these, and use first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastEditorUserId="130" LastEditDate="2013-02-15T01:41:23.897" LastActivityDate="2013-02-15T01:41:23.897" CommentCount="1" />

If you fill it still &quot;boiling&quot; the jam will be hotter than 100°C and then it is usually enough to wash the jar by hand and let it dry. (Jams I made this way easily last 2 years.) If your recipe is weaker (only hot fruit @80°C) you will probably want to sterilize your jars (and sort out any jars that smell or look dubious). (E.g. by putting your glasses in a steamer and steaming for 30 min.) And don't use damaged lids!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good jam jars have a good rubber seal in their lid.

If you are serious about making preserves every year, you might want to invest in glasses. The rubber seals should officially be changed every time, but tend to last much longer than that. You can use them for storing leftovers as well. They are much easier to wash than commercial jam jars, because they don't have a screwing mechanism and many of them have a straight &quot;neck&quot;.

Following this definition, something is either sustainable or not sustainable; sustainability cannot be “improved” or “worsened” (or it is merely the time before depletion that changes).&#xA;We are faced to the issue of sustainability because we live in a finite world, with limited amounts of the natural resources we depend upon. When we get rid of rubbish, we often condemn useable material to idleness, which brings us to constantly extract raw material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recycling means using raw material that has already been extracted; this reduces the need to extract even more of it to meet consumption wants. Simply enough, to be sustainable or to avoid depletion, the rate of extraction must be brought lower or equal to the natural replenishment rate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our use of forests is a good example of unsustainability : world forest cover has been shrinking quickly in the last decade, jeopardizing future generations' ability to enjoy its services (not only generations of humans, but also generations of animal forest dwellers). By recycling forestry products, such as paper and cardboard, we reduce the pressure put on forests and do not impede the latter's ability to replenish. In addition, making paper products form recycled fibers is much less energy demanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, here's the drawback :&#xA;Products made from recycled materials are often of lesser quality than the object for which the material was previously used. This is called downcycling; the idea that raw material cannot be reused infinitely is intrinsic to it. Also, recycling is an unsustainable activity if it engenders the excessive use of other resources (e.g. Oil for transportation, or energy for transformation). This may occur for certain materials that are shipped overseas to be managed in developing countries at a lower [financial, not environmental] cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, most of the time, recycling is effective in reducing the demand for raw products and energy. This is especially true when the recycled objects are made from substances that takes very long to regenerate, such as oil (of which all plastics are made).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For recycling to be unquestionably sustainable, it is necessary to review the way the material is transformed and re-processed. And for that reason, reusing before recycling is even better as we aim for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recycle Everything: Why We Must – How We Can (Janet Unruh, 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Story of Stuff (Annie Leonard, 2010)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18" LastActivityDate="2013-02-13T00:50:33.477" />

(For everyone &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the US, a cord is a unit of measure equivalent to 128 cubic feet of tightly stacked firewood, or 3.625 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. An acre is about 0.4 hectares. So the rule of thumb corresponds to about 9m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hectare.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(For anyone questioning the validity of this estimate, consider: a 100-year old maple tree could yield a cord of firewood, and you could plant about 100 maple trees on one acre at 20x20' spacing. With that said, it's just a rough way to estimate yields.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a rule of thumb, there are some variables to account for:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Different tree species have more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chimneysweeponline.com/howood.htm&quot;&gt;stored energy per unit of volume&lt;/a&gt;. E.g. Hop Hornbeam (Ironwood, &lt;em&gt;Ostrya virginiana&lt;/em&gt;) has 26.4 MBTU/cord (7.685 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while Willow    (&lt;em&gt;Salix spp.&lt;/em&gt;) has 14.2 MBTU/cord (4.133 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Different tree species grow at different rates. E.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://plants.usda.gov/java/charProfile?symbol=SASE10&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salix x sepulcralis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may grow to 45' (13m) in 20 years, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://plants.usda.gov/java/charProfile?symbol=OSVI&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ostrya virginiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might only reach 20' (6m). So while you can plant willow and get a ton of growth, you'll only get half the energy out of all the labor you'll have to do to harvest the firewood. I do the work to pull 6-8 cords off 10 acres every year with machines (tractor, winch, chainsaw, splitter) and it's a lot of work. I'd much rather have the denser wood, same energy, half the effort.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You ask &quot;how many saplings?&quot;, but that also depends on your species type and how you plan to manage the woodlot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You ask &quot;what would be the best species?&quot;. Personally, I would select 5-10 different species with different stored energy values, growth rates, and pest/disease resistance. If you get a beetle infestation that wipes out one species, you will only lose 10-20% of the total.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You ask &quot;optimal time to harvest?&quot;. Personally, I prefer to harvest trees that are 40-60 years old. In my woodlot, these are typically beech (&lt;em&gt;Fagus grandifolia&lt;/em&gt;) or maple (&lt;em&gt;Acer spp.&lt;/em&gt;) that are 18-30&quot; (45-75cm) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_at_breast_height&quot;&gt;DBH&lt;/a&gt;. You might be able to harvest smaller trees on a 20 year rotation, but then you're only getting logs that are perhaps 6&quot; (15cm) DBH. Again, that requires 3x the harvesting effort. Also, having mature trees in the woodlot means that they reseed themselves -- I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; do any planting (just thinning), nor do I remove stumps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You know how much you use, and once you know the mix of species that you're using you can make a rough calculation about how much energy (BTU or MJ) that works out to, and the volume (cords or m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that you'll need (assume an average energy density based on your preferred species mix). Then when you figure out your planting density (see &quot;other questions&quot; below), you know how much land area this will occupy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other questions you might ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are the labor requirements for harvesting a {cord,m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;} of firewood using various methods? (all manual, with machines, with draft animals)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What kind of storage do I need to build for curing firewood and then keeping it dry?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What planting density should I use for planting firewood? (Include the species mix you're going to use.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What management strategies work well for a firewood planting?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How can I get multiple uses out of land that is planted to firewood? (silvipasture / agroforestry)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer above assumes that you're heating with firewood &quot;conventionally&quot; -- relatively large (&gt;12&quot; DBH) trees that have been cut into ~16&quot; rounds and then split and dried. This is how I deal with wood. I have heard of (but am not familiar with) stoves that are set up to use smaller chunks of wood from &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; younger plantings, e.g. densely planted, fast growing, possibly coppiced species like willow or poplar on 10 year rotations.

If you don't measure what you're doing, you don't know if you're even making an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some cars have a fuel efficiency gauge on the dash but I don't recommend watching this as you drive.  The times at which the greatest gains can be made (i.e. accelerating) are exactly the same times when the most concentration is required to ensure you don't crash.  Crashing is not fuel efficient.  If you have an efficiency gauge in your car, check it at the end of each journey, not while you are driving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have one or even if you do, the tried and true method of &lt;em&gt;writing it down when you fill up on fuel&lt;/em&gt; is my recommendation.  For years when I owned a car I kept a notepad in the glove box that contained pre-drawn columns:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_______________________________________________________________________&#xA;|Date    |Odometer    |Fuel quantity    |Fuel cost    |Notes           |&#xA;|        |            |                 |             |                |&#xA;|        |            |                 |             |                |&#xA;|        |            |                 |             |                |&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From these values, you can calculate how far you traveled since the last fill-up and how much fuel you used to travel that distance and from that, what your &lt;em&gt;fuel efficiency&lt;/em&gt; was.  The cost isn't necessary for calculating efficiency but I found that information interesting too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to fill up consistently the same way each time.  This is usually achieved by simply holding the fuel pump trigger until it clicks off automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also buy car travel logs with similar columns (they usually have both &lt;em&gt;Start odometer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;End odometer&lt;/em&gt; columns).  In this modern age of iPhones, Andriods and 3G, you can enter your travel details straight into websites designed to calculate your fuel efficiency such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fuelly.com/&quot;&gt;Fuelly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpgtune.com/&quot;&gt;MPGTune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have been recording your actual fuel usage for a while, start changing one of the above suggestions at a time and don't change anything else for several fill-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to add a few notes from personal experience from when I went through improving my fuel efficiency.  I was driving a large 4WD so the fuel costs hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first two ideas I tried were what are called above &lt;strong&gt;defensive driving&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;don't accelerate too fast&lt;/strong&gt;.  Leaving a large gap in front of me meant that often the traffic lights would go green before I even needed to brake, meaning I didn't need to accelerate again and waste fuel.  Accelerating slowly simply uses less fuel to reach the same speed (but takes longer) however in small city traffic, I would usually catch the people who accelerated off ahead of me at the next set of red lights so I didn't end up being late due to my changed driving style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With these two techniques, I improved my &lt;em&gt;measured&lt;/em&gt; fuel efficiency from 15L/100Km to 11L/100Km.  (That's roughly 15mpg up to 21mpg).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't get to try any further ideas as I moved to London, sold my car and bought a bike.

Big truck like F-350 could fetch up to $1000 depending on the market, because it has a lot of iron in it. Those recyclers usually would save the wheels/tyres and battery to resell separately (thus reusing at least some parts), with the rest going into smasher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Important consideration is whether recycler properly disposes of hazardous materials, such as mineral oils, coolant and other chemicals or toxic metals, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suscon.org/autorecycling/&quot;&gt;it can be a problem&lt;/a&gt;. For more in-depth look at environmental impact of auto-recycling, there is 1994 UCLA dissertation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seas.ucla.edu/stenstro/d/denv13&quot;&gt;“Auto Recycler and Dismantler Facilities: Environmental Analysis of the Industry with a Focus on Storm Water Pollution”&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To increase reuse, one might take off and sell (eBay, Craigslist) or give away (Craigslist, Freecycle) some parts that are in demand, such as front and rear light assemblies, seats and door-panels etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Reuse&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would bother with reusing if the vehicle is in, or can be brought to, a good mechanical condition.

I would expect that this has a number of benefits for the soil such as reduced erosion. I would suggest phasing the thinning.  This has a few benefits including the fact that you may get more initial growth for things like kindling out of the initial high speed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest during the thinning phase, assuming young trees, that a simple rule might be that if the heads of the trees are touching, you can probably afford to thin half of the trees.  That gives them room to grow for the next phase without thinning them so far you might worry about too much erosion in the spring with the runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest also removing the weaker and smaller saplings if there is a difference there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for yelds, if you can saw the small logs on a jig and dry them out they can be useful for kindling in a wood stove.  We heat our house in Chelan with apple wood which cannot be easily split due to the way it has been pruned, and we just use smaller rounds as kindling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Species Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I share your concerns here.  I don't think there is a problem with selecting based on species in order to shift yields. This is a more tricky subject and probably pretty locally dependent so rather than try to provide a definitive answer, I will mention a few things to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many forests have an internal species progression where established trees of one species group enable the next stage of the progression to become established.  These progressions can take hundreds of years in some forests to reach maturity and obviously you don't want to wait that long.  In fact I know of old growth forests in national parks in Washington State, where such a progression has not reached maturity and probably won't for another few hundred years, assuming no fires or the like  (for example in Mt Ranier National Park a lot of the old growths in the lower areas are doug fir-dominated, but the next phase will be Western Hemlock)....  At the same time you may want to be familiar with it because you may be trying to either back things out or push things forward.   Being aware of such cycles is the first step in trying to harness them and it may shape the way you look at species selection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, in your area, beech and maple are probably the pinnacle species, so one thing you should keep in mind is that eventually these trees will likely dominate the other species.

The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is a large two-volume set, but each page is a micro-print reproduction of four pages of the standard edition.  if the book gets a significant amount of use, possibly over decades, it would be very hard to imagine a screen doing better.  This is one reason I am somewhat concerned about so much academic literature going into electronic form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading could range from there to colorful junk mail, resource-intensive to produce, read once and discarded by a small percentage of recipients....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just can't imagine that there is a single answer here even if we limit it to books.  Nonetheless, here are some back of the hand calculations for reading a 1/2 lb book once and recycling it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we start with US government figures and work back we get slightly under 1kWH per lb of paper in the recycling process.  Keep in mind printing still has to be taken into account and that isn't cheap either.  If we are comparing to a kindle, I couldn't find specific power figures (except that it &lt;em&gt;charges&lt;/em&gt; at 5 w), that would mean you'd have to read for about 100 hours to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the catch is as always, how much use does a book get?  If you read the Odyssey once every few years, you may quite easily get that 100 hours out of the book.

My point is just to highlight the relationship between surplus generated by consuming fossil fuels at an incredible rate, and the centralization both of manufacturing/distribution and of regulation and government, and the way this creates problems of sustainability.  I don't think there is any serious debate about whether a very large regulatory sector poses sustainability problems (if there is, I'd like to hear it) given that such a sector must consume resources and energy and is not producing.  Additionally a more robust craft movement makes it harder for government regulation to force people into unsustainable markets (say, banning sale of hand-made wooden children's toys so that we all have to buy plastic mass-produced trinkets from China), and it raises the demand for regulatory reform to cut back on laws already in place.  For example more cheese-makers will make it harder to push for making it harder to purchase milk which hasn't had the proteins denatured via ultrapasteurization.  (Ultrapasteurized milk won't curdle properly due to protein denaturization and chelation of calcium in the milk.)  Moreover these issues are not partisan issues.  They are corporatist vs craftsman issues, and the more craftsmen we have the better we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nor are historical parallels far to seek.  See Prof. Joseph Tainter's excellent work &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/052138673X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, I think crafts culture is an important piece of the puzzle.  Part of the goal has to be to retain our own surpluses instead of pushing them into the machines of centralization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastEditorUserId="130" LastEditDate="2013-02-19T01:38:11.503" LastActivityDate="2013-02-19T01:38:11.503" CommentCount="1" />

To achieve better mileage I would advocate the &lt;strong&gt;appropriate driving&lt;/strong&gt;. The term &lt;em&gt;defensive driving&lt;/em&gt; relates to proactive risk management of on-road hazards, and can be done regardless of speed and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arbitrary “slower speed” does not guarantee better fuel economy, as different vehicles have different optimal RPM range for any given gear (with highest gear being most economical). However, at motorway speeds aerodynamic drag plays ever increasing role, and that optimal RPM range is usually allows for lower speed than most people indulge themselves on the autobahn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, smooth acceleration and aptly timed deceleration is key, but there are instances where it does not hold true. For example if one pulls out of side street during a rush hour, and the choice is to accelerate rapidly to safely merge into traffic, or be faced with the long line of cars and couple of minutes of idling, the winner is clearly the former (more on evils of idling later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proper deceleration is important, because fast braking (even if one “drives defensively” well under speed limit) does nothing but converting kinetic energy into waste heat, whereas there are more efficient ways to slow down. Releasing throttle well ahead of time not only reduces wear of brake pads and tyres, but allows the car to use natural losses of energy (inside the engine and drivetrain, aerodynamic drag etc.) to slow itself down. Importantly, it has to be done in gear (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/3600/is-engine-braking-harmful/3610#3610&quot;&gt;engine braking&lt;/a&gt;) which qualifies as an &lt;em&gt;engine overrun&lt;/em&gt; condition (throttle is off and RPMs are higher than idle) at which point ECU on modern fuel-injected petrol motors &lt;em&gt;shuts off fuel delivery entirely&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to greatly reduce need for acceleration by planning ahead and properly timing the traffic signals, slowing down well ahead of red lights in order to roll onto green, or accelerating when needed to make the green light, to avoid idling on red.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;On Evils of Idling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next big thing is &lt;strong&gt;to reduce idling&lt;/strong&gt;. Besides the obvious “burning fuel with no miles” (0 MPG), there are more serious mechanical consideration against idling (even aforementioned fuel shut-off during overrun was primarily introduced to protect catalytic converter from incomplete combustion). Those are &lt;a href=&quot;http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/1772/is-idling-bad-for-your-engine/3428#3428&quot;&gt;enumerated elsewhere on SE&lt;/a&gt;, but in short that incomplete combustion leads to reducing effectiveness of spark plugs (which, in turn, further reduces fuel economy), glazing of combustion chamber, contaminating of oil, and excessive amount of water in exhaust system which increases corrosion. Moreover, idling produces more pollution from the same amount of fuel. For those concerned about implication of frequent stopping and restarting the vehicle, there is some math in above link, and more &lt;a href=&quot;http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/825/is-start-stop-technology-good-or-bad-for-my-car-alfa-mito/3566#3566&quot;&gt;in another&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practicality, this means turning off engine at long stop lights, railroad crossings, at the corner shop, and so forth, and reducing time spent warming up. Modern engines warm up better when they are put under moderate load rather than idling. And in the winter, one should protect the windscreen from defrosting with covered parking or putting blanket on it overnight, and to wear weather appropriate clothing, and not waiting for the car interior to turn into sauna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More Better&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other suggestions are also true: &lt;strong&gt;proper tyre pressure&lt;/strong&gt; (also, safety issue, as under-inflated tyres are at risk of overheating failure), &lt;strong&gt;low rolling resistance tyres&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/are-there-any-disadvantage-to-fuel-efficient-tires/3471#3471&quot;&gt;some concerns addressed&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;diligent maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; (plugs, wires, oil and filters affect performance in little ways that can add up), and &lt;strong&gt;removing unnecessary weight or aerodynamic impediments&lt;/strong&gt; (if you do not have skis or a bicycle on your roof rack, it has to go).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the mechanicals, &lt;strong&gt;alternative transportation&lt;/strong&gt; (walking, biking, public transport, motorcycling) and &lt;strong&gt;carpooling&lt;/strong&gt; can make an impact. Public transport generally takes longer time, but this time can be used more productively (reading, homework, work), one avoids traffic stress, parking costs, reduces wear, tear, and statistical possibility of an accident in own car. Also helps &lt;strong&gt;avoiding rush hour&lt;/strong&gt; when possible, and &lt;strong&gt;combining trips&lt;/strong&gt; (engine is more efficient at proper operating temperature, and many separate small trips do not allow motor to reach it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of the fuel usage (I use Fuelly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fuelly.com/driver/theUg&quot;&gt;personally&lt;/a&gt;) helps not only for monitoring effects of any particular approach, but can also point to problems if certain negative trends develop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above is very sensible practises that many can readily apply today in improving their driving habits without entering arcane realm of hardcore &lt;em&gt;hypermiling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="227" LastActivityDate="2013-02-19T05:30:59.843" CommentCount="7" />

The first potential advantage is how the variation throughout the year can be handled.  In a modern grid-tied solar PV system, you can bank electrical energy credits across many months, effectively generating power in July for use in January.  Thus the PV system can be sized based on the needed year-round average production instead of a guaranteed minimum production.  Looking at direct solar hot water, energy banking can usually only be done for a matter of days.  This means that a system with sufficient output in winter is likely to overproduce in summer.  If you heat with the solar hot water this is even more the case, since the system will be larger but heating is not needed during the maximum production months.  So the first potential advantage of PV over solar thermal is the percentage of generated energy that actually gets used, on a year-long basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second potential advantage is simplicity.  A solar thermal system cannot offset the total energy use of a home, since much of this is used as electricity.  Therefore the homeowner desiring to offset the entire household usage would end up buying and maintaining two different types of systems.  If the homeowner expects to buy a solar PV system anyway, they may simply find it easier to buy a single system rather than determine the balance between two systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If trying to heat water most efficiently with electricity, a heat pump water heater will raise the effective ratio of energy used to heat gained from .9 (for direct heating) to about 2.4.  Thus, a 20% efficient solar panel (a high number, but taking it from the question) would effectively be 48% efficient at heating water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="87" LastActivityDate="2013-02-20T02:20:30.060" CommentCount="2" />

Far from the gray-water recycling and/or humanure lot, etc..&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The lower quality well for irrigation and bigger volume output.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wells should be far enough from each other so that the lower one wouldn't significantly drain the one above. This can be avoided by deeper drilling.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And both wells should be used regularly to prevent 'clogging'. It can take some time until the underground water makes its path to supplement the water requirements of the well. When the well isn't used for certain time, those paths can detoriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's possible, build a tank or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_basin&quot;&gt;retention basin&lt;/a&gt; to keep the rain water for irrigation. It's the most sustainable way of using the rain water.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even if it could seem as a good idea I wouldn't join the retention pond with the well.

Natural gas is natural resource just like petroleum. They arise from similar processes and are generally found together although the ratios vary. Natural gas (particularly methane) is also produced by living organisms. As a natural resource, 'pure' sustainability would require you to consume at a rate less than it's produced by nature. Since petroleum and natural gas for the most part produced on geologic timescale, they would not generally be considered sustainable. However if you take the premise that sustainable is 'relative' than you could compare and contrast different non-renewable resources for their relative sustainability. For example, it appears new cheaper supplies of natural gas in the United States have led to reduced use of coal for producing electricity (&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703579804575441683910246338.html&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is considered cleaner burning than coal so that is generally seen as better for the environment.

When coal plants are retired (or new ones are not&#xA;  built), we believe that the right “loading order” for new energy&#xA;  sources would be: energy conservation and efficiency, solar and wind&#xA;  (preferring distributed over large-scale), geothermal and perhaps some&#xA;  wave energy, then natural gas to fill in the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether 'better for environment' is a sustainability topic is probably a separate question for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.sustainability.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt; site. Independent of the environmental issue, natural gas vs gasoline vs coal vs renewable resources is a relative. My guess is that it would be a similar list to the Sierra Club list above.

First and foremost, uncooked food can be subject to moderate salting and then lactic fermentation (sauerkraut, salami, yogurt, cheese, traditional pickles, etc).  Note that these are all &lt;em&gt;live, cultured&lt;/em&gt; foods and the combination of the pH and living culture are important.  Additionally many have added salt which aids preservation too.  Finally I would note that if you make traditional butter, you ferment the cream first and then salt it, and this way the butter will keep more than a few days.  (Edit to clarify:  Many, though not all, of these foods become shelf-stable at higher temperatures after fermentation too.  Examples include cheese, where well-aged cheese can be left out at room temperature without food borne illness risk.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chances are you aren't going to be above those temperatures so that should suffice.  If you are above those temperatures, alcoholic fermentation of fruit is possible and lactic fermentation, while possible, requires a great deal more salt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other concerns:  Yes, you do need to protect from animals and some animals are pretty crafty.  Ravens and racoons, for example, can easily get into all kinds of things.

Coming up with a sustainable workalike for gasoline is much harder, particularly if we want to use waste products to do it.

However, it's rarely clear that that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Washington State US is in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wregis.org&quot;&gt;WREGIS trading area&lt;/a&gt;, and that means that a green-energy tariff there is typically based on trading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/tracking.htm&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy Certificates&lt;/a&gt; on WREGIS. You'd have to do some digging to find out how much of your tariff premium actually goes to the renewable-energy generators, and how much additional capacity (if any) gets built as a result of that money. The answer there, will make a huge difference to answering your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it is about how much new renewable capacity gets built, because generally, renewables have extremely low short-run marginal costs - lower than the wholesale price of electricity - which means that they generate as much as they can anyway, so increasing short-run demand for renewable electricity, does not increase its short-run supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Propane - useful but filthy and unsustainable&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propane summary: if your green electricity tariff doesn't get new renewables built, and the marginal electricity generator in your area is coal, then it may be better to stick with propane for now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Propane is a fossil fuel, and so we know it's a contributor to catastrophic climate change, as well as being a resource that's being depleted unsustainably. So far, so bad. But a switch away is only worth it if it will reduce overall greenhouse-gas emissions. The problem is that if your green electricity tariff results in virtually no extra money going to renewable generators, and thus no additional renewable electricity, then your additional electricity demand from resistance heating or heat pump, will actually get met by fossil generation; and the sustainability impact could be even worse than using propane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Electrical resistance heating - very low capital impact, potentially high-impact operating impact&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance heating summary: If there's a net sustainability benefit from your green tariff, then electrical resistance heating offers the best contribution toward sustainability (but it will cost you money). Otherwise, it's the worst option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An electrical resistance heater and storage tank are very cheap to buy, but in operation are very intensive in terms of exergy in to energy out: electricity is a high-quality carrier of energy, whereas the low-grade heat in a hot-water tank is of lower quality - that is to say, there's less exergy per unit energy. To put it another way, getting low grade heat at an efficiency of 90-99% from electricity isn't really very efficient, despite seeming so from those numbers. On the plus side, the materials to make a resistance heater are very simple, so the whole-life sustainability impacts of the equipment, putting aside for one moment the cost of the electricity consumed, are very low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The net sustainability impact will all depend on what the net result of your green electricity tariff really is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Heat pump - efficient and complicated&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat pump summary: This might be the cheapest direct financial cost to you, if the heat pump is good enough; but is unlikely to be the best option from the sustainability angle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relative to resistance heating, a heat pump has worse sustainability impact for the equipment up front, and probably on disposal too. Actual real-world performance could give a Seasonal Performance Factor of anywhere between 1 and 5. That's equivalent to an average annual efficiency of 100-500%. The efficiency is influenced by the temperature of your heat source (higher is better), the temperature of your incoming water (higher is better), the temperature you're heating the water to (lower is better), the quality of the installation and equipment, and how well-specified the heat pump is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Looking forward to the Smart Grid&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Domestic electricity consumption that has the ability to turn up or down in response to the grid balancer, so-called &lt;strong&gt;Demand-Side Response&lt;/strong&gt;, is going to have an economic and sustainability value to the forthcoming Smart Grid. If you've got lots of &lt;em&gt;storage&lt;/em&gt; hydro on the grid already, then that value will be low. If you haven't, and if grid-balancing at the scale of seconds to minutes is done by fossil fuel, then the value could be high. In this case, electrical heating, and in particular resistance heating, is likely to be one of the better opportunities for Demand-Side Response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Extra options&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Solar thermal&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you've got enough unshaded south-facing surface, then solar thermal could provide a big chunk of your water-heating needs, depending on local climate and your seasonal usage pattern of hot water, in a more sustainable way than any of the other options. (solar thermal works economically in Denmark, and that's at a more northerly latitude than Washington State US - but the Danes do take advantage of the economies of scale).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Community heating&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you live in a high-density built environment, then getting together with your neighbours to set up a community heating scheme is probably the most sustainable option.

With that disclaimer in mind though I want to give a very different answer based largely on the work of anthropologist Joseph Tainter (&quot;The Collapse of Complex Socieites&quot;), and look at the relationship between surplus, complexity, and sustainability.  I don't think the relationship is a simple one, and yes there are cases where energy efficiency may make moderate-term sustainability harder to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also think it is necessary to take a long view both of the past and the future in addressing this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tainter's Theories on Complexity and Collapse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Tainter has authored a large survey of societal collapse (meaning, as he puts it, simplification), where the number of societal roles decreases radically, as does the coordination between them.  A good example would be the fall of the Western Roman Empire.  The survey is &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/052138673X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Collapse of Complex Societies&lt;/a&gt; and it is well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tainter's thesis is that complex societies collapse by simply becoming unsustainably complex, namely that we add complexity to society to solve problems and that at some point we can't keep that going, so major investments required to maintain a current quality of life usually foretell collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tainter also directly discusses the impact of energy (in the form of agricultural surplus) in the case of Rome.  During the expansion of Rome, the government was largely fueled by pillaging acculumated surpluses from elsewhere (or more properly proxies for that in the form of gold).  When this could not be continued, Rome had to move from accumulated past surpluses (representing, as he puts it &quot;past solar energy&quot;) to current production (as he puts it &quot;current solar energy&quot;).  This move was catastrophic for the Roman Empire and it lead to a spiral of currency devaluation, and eventually the inability to maintain food production up to the level it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the points that Tainter brings up is that much of the complexity added was actually there to stall the collapse, and that Rome would have fallen much sooner had they not added the complexity that they did.  However with complexity comes a large sector of the economy which is largely devoted to regulating the rest.  In modern parallels, this would include not only government but also business administration.  The more complex these fields become the fewer people are actually producing and eventually the whole thing collapses.  The level of detail he goes into is astounding and I recommend both watching what lectures he has on Youtube and reading the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Use Energy To Subsidize Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the age of fossil fuels, greater social complexity meant that people had to work harder.  The difference between a simple society governed by local self-sufficiency generally and a complex one with large amounts of regulation meant that in the second, people had to work much harder to achieve subsistence.  Historically of course the best example of this is moving from forraging to agriculture (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/2100251/Jared-Diamond-The-Worst-Mistake-in-the-History-of-the-Human-Race&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race by Jarrod Diamond&lt;/a&gt;).  In essence the agricultural revolution meant trading quality of life for larger populations and in order to make that work we see additional complexity arise in societies relating to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same thing applies to the so-called green revolution and the dawn of modern fossil-fuel-based agriculture but with a twist.  In the past humans and animals put forth the effort into tilling the soil, planting, harvesting, etc.  Now the humans and animals are replaced by machines, and the energy comes not from eating grain but from fossil fuels.  Similarly much of the nutrition of the soil comes from fossil fuels instead of decaying organic material, but to build and maintain the machines, associated supply pipelines, etc, many new roles had to arise, and farming came to embody more economic complexity.  This of course was only possible because the energy came from fossil fuels, and this was only possible because of a surplus, at the time, of fossil fuel-based energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Efficiency being good for Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the largest challenges sustainability-wise that we have is the fact that we are as dependent on fossil fuels as we are both for energy and for materials (coal, fertilizer, plastic, graphene, and much more).  Additionally demand for energy is increasing faster than supply and for this reason our individual embodied consumption must decrease at least for now.  The larger and more open question of course, is whether being more energy efficient for most of the population just means that their energy consumption can be spread out, where greater energy efficiency of appliances is offset by having more of them (this, itself, may not be a bad thing for reasons below, but it does nullify the effect).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally more energy sources become viable when we become more energy efficient.  It may not be sustainable to run cars on sweetgrass ethanol, but it might be if cars were twice as efficient (perhaps fuel-cell hybrids).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Efficiency being bad for Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two significant mechanisms by which increased energy efficiency might lead to unsustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is that we have to be honest, that real solutions to problems require large levels of economic investment and consequently if an economy which is based on ever increasing and unsustainable consumption of consumer products begins to falter, it may be much harder to engage in needed projects, such as grid upgrades necessary to guarantee baseline power from wind, or the like.  Having more sustainable products doesn't matter of people can't pay for them, and so the simplification of consumption which is needed to achieve sustainability also can thwart that same goal.  For example if electricity consumption drops, it is harder to justify investment into wind-based power generation and the grid upgrades necessary to make that happen.00&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second is that if we succeed in freeing up surplus energy we will, as history shows, want to use that energy to solve our problems and therefore the shift will be made from using it in ways which are necessary for human life and towards a regulatory role.  This can add to non-productive complexity and make it harder to solve the next challenges down the road.  For example, we could see an actual consumption drop in energy lead to an increase in energy consumption in businesses who then use that energy to subsidize complexity of their own operations, or the same for government.  The same goes for moving towards higher levels of technology, where greater complexity goes into engineering, manufacturing, and maintenance when compared to relatively simple technologies.  Each of these tasks takes energy and consequently, we become far more dependent on energy efficiency and less able to make investments in solving future problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have already pointed to a book written largely on this topic.

Farm monocultures for example can only be maintained with (artificial) fertilizers and often pesticides are also used. &#xA;Third, localisation reduces the power of multinational companies and a lot of multinationals have very poor track records when it comes to sustainability (e.g. Shell, Chevron, Dow Chemicals, Cargill). &#xA;Finally, although not directly related to sustainability, food that is produced in bulk is usually processed and then stored in warehouses for years before it is being consumed.

The Irish Potato Famine occurred because everyone was growing the same high yield strains of potatoes, because other crops were out of reach of the Irish peasants.  While this was a very energy efficient solution, it wasn't sustainable.  Therefore one of the concerns regarding sustainability needs to be robustness and this is where diversity comes in and mitigation of risks even if this comes with the loss of efficiency, at least if we define sustainability not to include massive famines or the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Diversity is the key mitigation strategy and it has two important components.  First, highly diverse systems help control pests the way we currently use pesticides (this is a key strategy of permaculture for pest control btw).  Secondly they limit damage because species-specific pests have greater trouble spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second important issue has to do with evolutionary ecology.  One of the key things to note is that ecological niches are not static but in fact change as environmental factors change.  Let's look at gypsy moths for example.  During an outbreak of these pests one thing that is observed is that predators specialize in ways they wouldn't before.  Animals that might eat gypsy moths in all stages may go for what they might find easier to catch, whether it is the actual moths (possibly bats), the caterpillers (some birds), or the like.  As the outbreak subsides, many of these will actually re-generalize.

If you compare a small bakery to a large bread factory, there are some optimizations that can happen with the latter that can't happen with the former (for starters, the ovens, by virtue of being larger, will have higher volume to surface area ratios and this reduces accidental energy loss).  Similarly centralized transportation requires less inputs than decentralized transportation.  The farmer who takes 500lbs of produce in his pickup truck 200 miles to sell at a farmer's market uses up a lot of fossil fuels compared to what would happen if things were shipped in larger quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taken to its extreme I think one might be tempted to say that Walmart is good from a sustainability perspective because it saves us from farmer's markets and local bakeries.  The problem is though this optimizes (and optimizes badly, I might add) for only one factor and thus, in my view runs the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I say why I think that runs the wrong point it is worth saying that a lot of things &lt;em&gt;cant&lt;/em&gt; be localized.  Many of the higher technology components, like solar cells, really do require a certain economy of scale even to hit break-even points energy-wise.  For this reason I don't think that things go all one way.  This being said, I think sustainability requires to some extent decentralizing the economy from where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization and Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our current system of food production, distribution, and processing is very energy-intensive.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;majority of this is in indirect costs&lt;/a&gt;, such as pesticides and fertilizers.  The massive use of fossil fuels allows modern large-scale farming techniques and there is no current substitute which allows downsizing our nation's farms without the large input of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the congressional report cited above notes that the majority of energy consumed in the production of most crops is in the manufacture of fertilizers and pesticides, not the use of diesel to plow land, harvest, etc.  Cutting down on fossil fuels in agriculture thus means abandoning large-scale mechanized farming of hundreds of acres and a move towards smaller scale, where concerns over soil fertility, pest control, etc can be managed through biodiversity.  Thus liquid biomass fuels don't really even approach a solution for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary contenders to solve this problem both require downsizing farms and replacing cheap fossil fuel inputs with more expensive human inputs.  These include smaller scale organic farming (note that draft animals are &lt;a href=&quot;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-12-farming-horses_x.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;making a comeback&lt;/a&gt; as a reaction to high fuel prices.  Organic farming by draft animal potentially gets rid of the vast majority of fossil fuel inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other possibility is permaculture, which tries to harness natural dynamics between species for support of plants and control of disease.  Permaculture is small-scale, however, and while it is high yield at low inputs, most of the human-directed inputs are directly human.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see any possibility of achieving sustainability without decentralizing farming.  This means a shift of inputs from fossil fuels to people and animals.  That has a lot of implications regarding lifestyles, and a need to significantly downsize energy consumption in order to make that happen (more people working in agriculture, fewer in energy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization and Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some materials in this area do not work well from a standpoint of localization and so manufacturing and distribution of these may not be able to be localized.  However, I think that there are still very important benefits from thinking about the problems in terms of localization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is that the most promising technology to replace fossil fuels for electricity generation is wind power, at least given current EROI figures.  Wind has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_return_on_investment_%28EROI%29_for_wind_energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;very good EROI&lt;/a&gt;.  The real challenge is that wind is fickle and unreliable, and so it is hard to generate baseline energy over a small area.  One solution for this to have large numbers of geographically dispersed wind farms but this requires a power grid designed for a level of what might be described as &quot;chaos&quot; that they are not designed for today (where things are based on large, reasonably dependable power plants serving specific areas).  Thinking in terms of localized production, done well, is an important aspect I think to more distributed energy production (and Wind requires thinking about energy production in a distributed manner).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second point is that there have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/03/29/cargill-adds-second-dairy-farm-methane-to-power-digester/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;installations&lt;/a&gt; of methane digesters at commercial dairy farms.  Whether CAFO-modelled dairy farms may not be sustainable, the idea of smaller scale, local energy production off of material that would otherwise be discarded is very positive development sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization and Waste Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final area where I think that is important to consider here is the idea of local material cycles.  Our current approach can be described as &quot;factory to landfill&quot; and the problem with this is that recycling becomes somewhat problematic and requires heavy centralization.  While some areas of recycling can be centralized, things like organic material are harder to do so.  We can't exactly ship sewage or compost effectively over the railway system and so the ability to take waste products and turn them into useful products is reduced by over-centralization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Waste management is closely tied to energy and agriculture however.  New York City is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/science/09sewage.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;moving towards&lt;/a&gt; harvesting methane from sewage treatment for electrical power, and they are not alone.   Some forms of fertilizer come out of wastewater treatment and there are many other products which can be seen as locally produced in this way as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robustness vs Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With modern agriculture and global distribution of food, we still see famines as a result of civil war and other factors, where disruption of distribution, in the distribution network leads to catastrophic human costs.  There are major issues here including the over-centralization of agriculture globally and this raises very significant social and economic sustainability concerns.  Overreliance on long-distance trade raises concerns about robustness.  This means that overcentralization trades efficiency for a lack of robustness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, I think decentralization, re-ruralization, and localization, compared to where we are today, are necessary for attaining sustainability.  This does not mean however, that everything can be decentralized.  Some things may require greater economies of scale to be viable.  However our centralization today is heavily subsidized by fossil fuels and to kick that dependency one must move somewhat in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastActivityDate="2013-03-03T12:13:26.460" />

[3M make a reflective film specifically aimed at this application]. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is very seldom mentioned or used, modest but useful gains in output can be achieved by cooling the panel somewhat. Whether this is worthwhile depends on available means of cooling. Water cooling works very well but is not usually practical, and air cooling is a possibly but liable to be pursued only by the &quot;excessively enthused&quot; :-). With the present low and falling cost of PV panels, just buying one more is usually more economical than trying to get more power out of a given number of panels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that available energy is related to light level and that cloudy or end of day outputs will be well down on peak outputs. While this sounds obvious, numerous solar product makers do not make this clear. THE most important requirement is a clear line of sight between the panel surface and the sun (or brightest spot in sky). On a full sun day, if direct sunlight does not fall on the panel the out[ut will be under 10% in most cases and perhaps as high as 20% if an exceptionally good reflective  path is available. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very bright cloudy day such that the sun location cannot be determined but the cloud is so bright as to hurt your eyes will give perhaps 20% - 30% of full output. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight through a window will give perhaps 80% of full output &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; direct sunlight falls on the whole panel surface. Otherwise output will be poor, as above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In low insolation areas (which would include the UK) it is vital that panels are mounted  at the correct elevation angle, and changing this a few times per year will give you slightly better output.

Midday sun angle from horizontal is 60 degrees in midsummer, about 15 degrees !!! in midwinter and about 30 degrees at present. What angle you set your panels to depends on whether you can alter the angle  occasionally throughout the year or intend to leave them at a fixed angle. Fixed optimum angle depends on whether you want maximum energy overall or maximum winter output or some other choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SHrPS.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="318" LastEditorUserId="318" LastEditDate="2013-03-04T14:48:45.297" LastActivityDate="2013-03-04T14:48:45.297" />

Other perspectives of course are welcome and the whole purpose is to provide public insight into what's on and off topic here so please vote on these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problems @Pitt noted above are design issues with well understood solutions, which include biodiversity for starters (so that removing part of one species enables fallback on others).  The larger barrier of course is knowledge.  Permaculture involves working smarter rather than harder, and so reducing the overall energy inputs.  This means humans have to do most stuff, you can't leave it to machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that permaculture is an important aspect of any attempt to become sustainable because it is sustainable itself, because we must mimic natural ecosystems in our own approaches to material and waste management, and because it cultivates interconnected and sustainable communities on all levels.  This is not to say that there aren't challenges regarding human inputs and knowledge levels, and that these may have impacts elsewhere.  On the whole, I think that widespread permaculture is a good thing however.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permaculture is Sustainable Itself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Permaculture is sustainable with few external inputs.  Permaculture utilizes processes of evolutionary ecology to replace most of the external direct energy inputs aside from the sun, as well as all indirect inputs beyond the initial design and implementation phase.  This largely cuts fossil fuels out of the system of food production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Permaculture utilizes carefully chosen plants and domestic animals, as well as sometimes wildlife, for pest control.  For example one might plant thorny hedges to keep deer out of the food production area, while providing habitat for birds of prey so that that they can prevent rodents from becoming a problem.  Pests an never be entirely eliminated because predators always lag behind pests, but in this way they can be controlled so that they do not cause substantial damage in established permacultures.  A good beginner's book on this subject is &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1603580298&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gaia's Garden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second point is that species are arranged in ways which mutually support eachother.  I haven't been able to experiment with this but a example of an area where this might be helpful might be co-raising cattle and horses, together in an area that has snow so as to minimize the need for hay.  Cattle won't eat what they can't see so they tend to starve quickly when it snows, but horses will kick the snow away to eat.  Thus the horses can be used to help the cattle forage in winter.  If areas are maintained with sufficient forage, hay may not even be necessary (there are recorded cases of cowboys with herds stuck in winter storms following mustang herds in order to ensure the cattle could eat, and thus saving their herds).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Necessity for Material Lifecycles to Mimic Ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an ecosystem, the waste product of one species or element becomes the input of another.  Bears poop in the woods.  Micro-organisms break down the poop and they release waste products which plants take in.  Those plants may produce fruit and the bears eat the fruit.  The bears then poop and the cycle repeats.  This example shows the way in which nutrient cycles work in ecosystems, re-using and re-cycling all components and over time building quality soils and very efficient ways of transforming current solar energy into biological energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sustainability requires, among other things, that we stop polluting our environment with things which cannot readily be re-used in the biological context.  For this reason it is very important to develop closed material lifecycles.  Our current factory-to-landfill must eventually be replaced with a closed cycle where very little if anything ends up in land fills because everything is re-used in some context or another.  Doing this requires in essence having the output or waste of one system becoming the input of another.  Recycling is one way this can happen (re-use is another), but either way waste must be re-purposed as an asset.  An example might be privatizing sewage treatment, not as a waste disposal service, but as a series of cooking gas and fertilizer factories.  Waste products which cannot be recycled can be re-used in unexpected ways, such as building things out of &quot;urbanite.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shift in thinking from a factory to landfill pipeline to a series of interconnected and infinitely continuous series of material lifecycles (akin to the water cycle, or to nutrient cycles in ecosystems), is absolutely necessary to achieving sustainability, and permaculture teaches this quite a bit.  This is a reason why I am such of a fan of urban permaculture.  While the idea of feeding a family of 4 on a city lot is probably unrealistic, the lessons learned about sustainability and the increase in free time from doing so (instead of high maintenance flower gardens!) is well worth it.  Most of my &quot;flower gardens&quot; also produce fruits and veggies, they look nice, and they require very, very little maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on the output of one component being the input of another has the potential at least to build close-knit, sustainable communities through garden exchanges, and also things like thinking about what one can re-use things that would otherwise be discarded.  Urbanite as a building material for small projects (say outdoor pizza ovens) comes to mind but the possibilities here are really endless.  The more we think about what we can do with waste, the less of it ends up being discarded in unsustainable ways and the closer we become as communities as we utilize the waste products of neighbors and vice versa,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big one actually is manpower (and this is an issue for most green energy too btw but for very different reasons), and the second is education.  Building permacultures requires years of practice and/or significant training.  It also turns food production into an intellectually challenging activity.  However it is also less physically challenging than conventional agriculture in many cases, and so there are possibilities of closing loops here.  The problem with manpower though is not so easily overlooked.  With modern fossil-fuel-based agriculture it is not hard for an individual to successfully farm vast tracts of land, possibly in the hundreds of acres, with only seasonal help.  Permaculture requires more &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; to be working in food production.  It also requires that people make more careful choices regarding foods to consume (grains are less sustainable than chestnuts for example, and wheat is less sustainable than rice).  More people in &quot;farming&quot; full-time means fewer people engineering green energy solutions and the like.  Competition for manpower is thus a significant concern as I see it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR - Short version&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see permaculture as pretty close to a necessity for achieving sustainability both due to its direct effects and also its indirect effects.  I also see permaculture ultimately as the best current training ground for the sorts of patterns we must develop in order to achieve sustainability generally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastEditorUserId="353" LastEditDate="2013-03-14T11:18:19.957" LastActivityDate="2013-03-14T11:18:19.957" />

I think that there are a few that need to weigh in a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest one is access to either of these types of stores to buy the products. For me, IKEA is a two hour drive each way. I could get to a Target or Walmart in 15-20 minutes, so it would probably be better to get self-assembly furniture there instead and save the longer trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, buying used can be even closer to home, especially if you are buying second hand from others. However, in terms of driving time, you likely will buy from a diverse group of people to get all the furniture you need, which could mean lots of individual trips, versus one trip to get the self-assembly furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in terms of initial purchase time and driving time, this could learn more towards self-assembly in my book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second step is then the actual moving. Again there are two options, sell or ship. For shorter moves, I would guess that it is better to just move the furniture versus again driving all over town to get &quot;new&quot; furniture (really just different if you are buying used :) ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of selling your furniture, I would guess that there is a decent disparity between the price that you can get for a piece of self-assembly furniture v. a used piece of quality furniture. In my experience, self-assembly furniture is at least half price what you would pay in store if buying used. Standard furniture you can seomtimes sell for as much or more than you bought it used. (This is probably more the disparity between new and used than a direct relation to quality. Also it is far easier to look up the price of an IKEA piece of furniture than other used furniture, so the &quot;new&quot; price is more known.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not that price is the ultimate decider in terms of sustainability, but I find that it has a definite influence on the ability to accept a green practice. When someone knows that they will be hard pressed to recover the cost of a product and deem it fairly cheap to begin with, it is more likely to be thrown away than sold or shipped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my primary consideration (having moved 3 times in the past year), is the ability to pack around the furniture.

I also had some furniture of both that was either seriously worn or cumbersome to move, so we donated that to a local thrift store.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to be moving often, I would want to limit the number of moving trucks and I think that this can be done with either type of furniture as long as you are willing to pack in around the furniture (which may depend on the moving company more than anything).

Your typical worm bin tends to operate at a low temperature (otherwise the worms would bake!). This would be slower normally, but the worms speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the overall heat increases (usually as a result of the proper mix of materials and frequent turning), the speed of the material breakdown increases. (For example a commercial system like this - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotrotsolutions.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.hotrotsolutions.com/&lt;/a&gt; - can yield compost in as little as 10-14 days according to their site.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, you need a hotter, more active system to really breakdown a lot of biodegradable plastics. Not that they won't eventually break down in your regular compost systems, but they likely won't break down as quickly as the other materials, leaving plastic pieces mixed in the compost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other consideration would be whether this adds any value to the worms. I have found vermicomposting to be like raising a pet, allows having to make sure that they have the right amount of food and water. Much of the material that you put in the system breaks down quickly because the worms are either eating it or using it as bedding. I guess that the plastic could be a form of bedding (this is pure speculation) but because I would assume that it would break down much slower than the newspaper that it more commonly used, it is likely to end up gumming up your system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="329" LastActivityDate="2013-03-09T09:55:30.963" CommentCount="1" />

Finally the foods we normally prefer to eat are of questionable sustainability.  Our culture sees home gardening as a hobby and something which provides at best a small supplement to commercially grown foods.  This means if you start growing cabbages and tomatoes in your front yard, neighbors may complain, and there have been people fined for zoning law violations for growing too many vegetables in their city lots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, alternatives which can match the constraints but understanding the constraints are necessary first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to also expand on the question of sustainability of current preferences regarding vegetables.  We mostly eat annuals in this role, and they mostly fall into the ecological role of &quot;pioneer species&quot; in fertile areas, which prefer to grow on disturbed fertile soil, and help prepare the soil for the next wave of plants.  However, perpetually disturbing the soil has significant costs fertility-wise which is why chemical fertilizers (usually made from fossil fuels) are necessary.  This isn't to say we should abandon lettuce, tomatoes, and cabbage, but it is to say that we may want to be more careful about where and how much of these we grow and consume.  Alternative, perennial vegetables are more sustainable when grown right and they deserve much more space than we give them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Western culture &lt;em&gt;used to&lt;/em&gt; eat a fair number of perennial veggies (and we still eat a few like asparagus) but these have frequently fallen by the wayside, which is a shame sustainability-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usefulness in Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I totally agree that done right, urban food production is an important aspect of sustainability.  It is unlikely to mean that cities are self-sufficient, food-wise, but it does mean that fewer energy inputs are required because less food has to move at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in addition I am in particular a fan of urban &lt;em&gt;permaculture&lt;/em&gt; because this provides higher yields with fewer inputs, and it provides general sustainability training of a sort that is otherwise quite irreplaceable (see my proposed answer to the connection of permaculture and sustainability).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Interlude:  Victory Gardens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In WWII, one interesting aspect of the war effort was the promotion of victory gardens by the White House as a matter of easing pressure on domestic food sources brought on both by the war effort and the internment of Japanese-American farmers.   By the end of the war it was estimated that around half of the produce grown in the United States was grown in private lots and city parks.  So while this does not necessarily lead to self-sufficiency regarding food in cities, it certainly helps reduce the burdens on transportation and fossil-fueled agribusiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some thoughts on urban permaculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One aspect of my own gardens at the house in Chelan, WA is that a lot of garden space is actually multi-purposed.  I have many flowers which produce edible tubers, or are useful in herbal medicine, or even produce edible fruit.

The pump is not intended to have a very high &quot;head&quot; or lift distance above floor level, but must have enough pressure to piump water above the level of a wash-tub as this is usually what is used as the water drain. Such pumps will be able to pump water &quot;somewhat higher&quot;. Flow rate will drop with increasing height, but a tank mounted slightly above toilet tank level will be able to be filled. From there it is &quot;easy enough&quot; to take a pipe to the toilet water inlet.  If desired you could use an independent inlet with its own valve so the mains feed is left in place with the tap turned off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that washing machine water will contain soap scum and dirt from clothes, which is liable to build up in storage tank, cistern and vales and pipe and need occasional cleaning. Filtering, settling and careful positioning of the toilet feed pipe ebtry will minimise this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small electric pump could be used to transfer water from a lower level tank or a handpump could be used. You may wish to figure pump and pumping costs into your calculations if you want to know how &quot;green&quot; your solution is overall. In my country (New Zealand) the water for a toilet cistern fill costs about 3 cents and the electricity required to lift this one meter (assuming a fairly inefficient system) costs about 0.01 cents, so the reuse costs about 300 times less. Electric pumps can come from windscreen washer pumps (good lift, low rate, more easily blocked, usually 12V operation), electric washing machine pumps (fairly ideal: mains powered, OK lift, find in junk-yard) and more.

These provide good sustainability through good use of energy, long number of cycles so less recycling, and relatively benign breakdown products. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are now a large number of brands of low self discharge NimH batteries available. Of these the best known and best specified and probably &quot;safest bet&quot; are the Sanyo Eneloop cells that &lt;strong&gt;Eric&lt;/strong&gt; mentioned. Others may also be very good, but technical information is usually far less available than for Eneloops cells, and many less known brands will be sourced from equally unknown makers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new Eneloop batteries have much longer cycle lifetimes that the old ones - the new ones have a &quot;crown&quot; symbol on them. Take great care - many people sell the old style ones and claim them to be new and there are many fakes/clones/ripoffs made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NimH cells contain Nickel which is not one of the banned &quot;ROHS&quot; materials but has some disposal impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LiIon:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are prepared to use less standard voltages - ie will not drop straight in to a standard torch or radio, then lithium Ion (LiIon) can be good. Energy discharge/charge efficiency is good. Cycle life is usually about 500 cycles, but if the circuitry is designed well and a reduction in available capacity is acceptable then the cycle life can be 1000+ cycles. LiIon are capable of extremely violent destruction if faulty. &quot;Vent with flames&quot; is a cute but descriptive term sometimes used. cf Dream Liner batteries :-(.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best of all&lt;/strong&gt;, but less know so far, are &lt;strong&gt;Lithium Ferro Phosphate&lt;/strong&gt; (LiFePO4). These are related to Lithium Ion but have an inbuilt crystalline (&quot;Olivine&quot;) structure which prevents mechanical &quot;pumping&quot; during use cycles and allows very long lifetimes, at the cost of reduced capacity per size or weight due to the need to included the electrically inactive Olivine structure). Cycle lives of 3000 cycles are reasonably easily achieved and larger versions with special care can get 5000++ cycle. Energy out/in efficiency is excellent and they work over extended temperature ranges (say -20C to +60C) and allow higher discharge rates than most LiIon. They are very stable and do not have LiIons melt-down mode. You can drive a spike through their heart and not provoke them to violence. If the dreamliners had used these they would still be flying.&#xA;LiFePO4 have lower energy densities than LiIon or NimH (larger or heavier for same energy stored) so are less favoured by those who insist on the very lightest or very smallest devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LiIon and LiFePO4 are both environmentally friendly. Discharge them fully (especially LiIon) then drill multiple holes through them and leave soaking in water. Dilute and pour on garden :-). [Lithium can be commercially extracted from sea-water - sending it back there in dilute form is sending it home).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LiFePO4 cost MORE per energy to buy but give the lowest cost of whole lifetime ownership of any available battery, they are about as energy efficient as any, and are probably about as environmentally friendly as you can reasonably get. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Added:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good site for battery information in general is &lt;a href=&quot;http://batteryuniversity.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

That won't fulfill the 'easy' part right away, but some Python or Excel macros would likely make it pretty functional for everyday use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative might be something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sustainableminds.com/software&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sustainable Minds&lt;/a&gt;, which is not free, but is designed to be very easy to use. It's aimed at designers and iteration, so it might not be ideal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One sidenote is that assessing the social impacts of products/processes is something that's still very much in basic research. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: There's a reason LCA tools cost money, and it's because it requires a lot of time and effort to generate the underlying data. You can either deal with a free but limited subset of the data and invest time, or invest money, perhaps in a simpler tool.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2013-03-14T16:25:57.750" CommentCount="1" />

The idea is that the charcoal improves the soil's carbon content and functions as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2. This would be especially useful for depleted soils. The idea of using charcoil to enhance to soil was derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta&quot;&gt;Terra Preta&lt;/a&gt; found in the Amazone. Terra Preta is very dark and rich soil with high content of charcoil that supposedly was created by Amazone natives between 450 BC and 950 AD. However, research has to point out how much of the idea behind biochar is actually true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can either buy Biochar (a list of sellers drawn up in Nov 2011 is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://biochar.bioenergylists.org/buy_biochar&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) or you can make it yourself via &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis&quot;&gt;pyrolysis&lt;/a&gt;, which is burning organic materials with very low levels of oxygen.

Raw biochar needs to be mixed with compost and water before adding it to your garden or else it will draw nutrients and water away from your plants. How much to add depends on the type of soil you have and possibly on what you want to grow, so you may want to do a soil analysis first. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is quite a bit of professional research going on, as well as people experimenting themselves (just search the internet).

Be careful re &quot;dimmable&quot; - some LED bulbs are, some aren't. Some can use standard phase control dimmers, while others can be dimmed only by using a custom control unit.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When replacing a 75 Watt incandescent you need ABOUT 10 - 15 Watts of LED power input  to produce the same total light output (lumens), &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; as the LED light is well directed in this application, the directionality of the LEDs compared to incandescent bulbs means that you would probably be happy with 5 to 10 Watts of total LED power. As LED lumen/Watt efficiency is going up continually, even 5 Watts can be &quot;very very bright&quot; in many applications. (An incandesecnt bulb may produce 15 lumen/Watt. Good modern LEDs give in excess of 120 l/W and last time I checked the top available-to-buy offering from Cree was managig 200 l/W in some very specific circumstances.). Whole lamp l/W will be less than for the LEDs alone due to diffusers, reflectors, power supply losses and stupid designs, but approaching 100 l/W is common enough and higher is becoming available. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most basic but easiest method would be to start with LEDs and suitable heat sink mountings and use an external power supply fed through the existing wiring. This would allow the lamp to be very close to standard in appearance but involves non standard playing at the other end of the wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closest to 'plug in and go&quot; (apart from a correctly fitting lamp) is any of the many many LED lamps now available that meets your spec as above, some bases from old bulbs , some suitable adhesive and time skill and patience. With the correct LED lamp it's literally just a matter of connecting the 2 existing wires to the 2 wires from the bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important factor in many cases is the LED lamp's CRI (Colour Rendering Index). This is a subjective measurement based on a number of colour samples which tells you how well the LED renders the colours of various items compared to a standard tungsten filament incandescent lamp. A tugsten lamp is defined as having a CRI of 100 and LEds can approach that when great care is taken. Not surprisingly, Philips are among the leaders in making high CRI LED lamps.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRI of &gt;= 90 is extremely good and few would notice the difference.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRI of 80 is good for most purposes by a degree of colour difference is noticeable by many people. Most tasks can be done without major problems.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRI of 70 gives light which definitely gives non-tungsten results. These are acceptable in many applications but the difference is clear. eg you'd happily eat a meal, read a book, do homework etc. Colours would be &quot;off&quot; but this would not generally matter except when the colour was a significant part of the task eg looking at photos.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRI of 60 is OK for area illumination where colour is not at all important. Camping, tyre changing, night time sports, market stalls (colour suffers), ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRI of under 60 will usually be an actinic blue tinged light pretending to be White. Such LEds are also usually low quality and low lifetime. Their advantages are high light output per power input, all else being equal. Don't buy them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hand in hand with CRI is CCT (correlated colo[u]r temperature - but if you get the CRI that you want then CCT will follow. CCT is expressed in degrees Kelvin (same size degree steps as Celsius but starting at absolute zero of = -273 C.)  Tungsten has a CCT of about 2900 K, Halogen 3200K, sunlight 5600 K, shade about 7500K. To get a CRI of near 100, CCT will be around 2800K. A CCT of about 6000K is getting down to a CRI of about 70. I personally prefer light of about 6000-7000 K to that of tungsten - slightly on the shady side of noon sunlight. Some love the horrible orange yukky look of tungsten bulbs :-). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See pictures at end.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two crucial points are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LED lifetimes are greatly affected by temperature. Keeping them cool is necessary if their days are to be long on the face of the land. Much effort is put into keeping the LEDs at an OK temperature when used in a standard light fitting. If the fitting you are using has obstructed or limited air flow (which is very likely to be the case) then you need to ensure that 'bulb' temperature stays below manufacturers maximum rating. This may required forced air (hidden small fan), or extra metal heat sinking, or running more bulbs than you need at less than full power per bulb. If they share a common air space then having multiple bulbs may still result in excessive temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand matters. Y' don't buy no ugly truck!.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you want good lifetime it pays to ensure that the LEDs proper are made by a master in the dark arts, or has  licenced technology from one such.  No name no provenance (usually) Asian LEDs can be very good but, alas, more often than not will go down into the grave at a faster rate than is nice. There are industry standard certifications which such products are required to meet to stop the use of junk. I don'y know how well such schemes are policed and certified at the US end, but I do know from extensive general experience at the Asian end of things, that many certifications (CE, ROHS, UL, ....) are quite commonly no more than a printed label. I'm in NZ and have NO factory in China (or anywhere else) and have received invoices in exchange for which the company involved will provide certification that they have visited my factories and that I am doing things as they should be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An incomplete list of masters of the arcane art of long life LED design includes   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips (lumileds, luxeon) - possibly the world's leading exponents of the art.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(Founded 1891.

They also sell their LED die to 3rd party encapsulators. Hopefully they do technology transfer of what it trakes to do good encapsulation as well as encapsulation and lead frames are crucial to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP / Avago  (who do all things well as long as it's not the printer/scanner side of the busines)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seoul Semiconductor  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osram  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and perhaps a few more independently PLUS all their cross licencees.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; If in doubt, buy Philips in one of its guises. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;: I have no financial interest in Philips or any other LED maker (sadly).

I don't think you're supposed to eat the shell in that case, but the baking would kill any salmonella and then you could grind them up for other uses. Then again there might be bits of cake stuck to them. Haven't tried it myself, yet. An alternative would be just to pop them in the oven while you're baking something else.

The best way to prevent this is with a fan of some sort, to keep the air moving and mixing.    You may find that use of a fan by itself captures a fair bit of your cooking heat and that this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a warning however, I have noticed a few major problems with re-capturing electrical cooking heat.  In particular if the heat is used to boil water, I have found that the opposite of what I expected to happen in fact did --- the house was made &lt;em&gt;colder&lt;/em&gt; by the added hot steam, compared to not cooking at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My working theory is that what happens is that the steam condenses on the windows and other surfaces that are not as well insulated.  They deposit heat there, and then evaporate slowly pulling heat from the room to do so.

Any small modern silicon bridge rectifier from a hobby electronics shop with a rating of 0.5A or more will do. Voltage rating of any bridge rectifier being sold will be &gt; 6VAC so is unimportant. You MAY find some very very very (decades) old Germanium or copper oxide or selenium rectifiers. Do not use them. A suitable modern bridge rectifier should cost well under 1 GBP. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bridge rectifier has 4 terminals - two AC inputs (connect either way to the dynamo output wires) and a positive and negative output. Positive goes to battery positive, negative to battery negative, 2 x AC input go to dynamo. Adding a filter capacitor would help if you were powering other equipment rather than battery charging, but for battery charging it is not strictly necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use a &quot;regulator&quot; between the battery and dynamo but, for initial investigation, the most that is strictly essential is a means of limiting maximum voltage applied to the battery. The simplest and most effective means in this context is a &quot;clamp regulator&quot;. This has 2 wires, connects directly to the battery and usually does nothing whatsoever. If the battery ever rises to a certain present voltage under charge the clamp regulator will &quot;shunt&quot; current to limit the battery voltage to the desired maximum. The regulator can be more complex than that, but that will do well enough in this context in many cases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery types:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anything rechargeable&quot; :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LiIon or Lithium Polymer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;OK&#xA;MUST have a voltage clamp at 4.2V or perhaps a little lower.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;MUST have.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A zener diode is &quot;too soft&quot;. &#xA;Ask if more information needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LiFePO4 similar to LiIon but lower clamp voltage needed.

They say    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot; ... For a 20&quot; wheel, sustaining speeds over 25km/h (~15.5mph) for long periods may overload the power regulator so we discourage riding above this speed with the power regulator engaged. 3W hubs can also generate more power than 2.4W ones under the same speed. The 20&quot;-25km/h rating is for a 2.4W hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For larger wheels, proportionately greater speeds can be sustained. Our tests show that a standard 26&quot; wheel can go up to 35~40km/hr (21~25mph) without any problem for the power regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My 26&quot; where example noted that 30 mph gave 360 RPM - so their safe max speed is about say 300 RPM. Achievable RPM with a wind turbine will depend on design or happenstance, but 300 RPM is an unusually low expected maximum RPM for a wind turbine - possible even for one with bicycle wheel rotor with duct-tape blades (I like it). You can certainly limit the speed by various means BUT you should not need to. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When they say &quot; ...

To summarize what is told there (check for more detail), there would be several considerations as related to energy use and sustainability:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Idling in itself wastes fuel for no good reason, and that adds up. In US (country whose residents drive probably more than anyone else on Earth, to put it in perspective) the average cars idles 16 minutes a day (including warming up, waiting, and sitting in traffic). Even 2.0 L compact car would burn (at a rate of 1 L per hour) almost 100 L of fuel a year. Obviously, some idling is unavoidable, but even half of that saved and multiplied by the number of all the cars in the world would amount to significant impact.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Idling negatively affects the engine internals due to incomplete combustion (glazing of the combustion chamber, fouling of the spark plugs) which further decreases fuel efficiency for all other regimes of operation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What’s more, excessive idling affects other components (burning up of the catalytic converter, increased corrosion of exhaust system, increased engine wear due to higher vibration etc.), whose premature wear and replacement lead to increased use of raw materials.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What one can do (and what I do) is to turn off engine during long traffic lights, railway crossings and so forth. Anything more than 10 to 15 seconds (very generously) would save fuel, because car that is already warm does not need that much effort to re-start, as it is at the proper operating temperature, and oil is distributed around the engine and at a high lubricity. Motor stays within the efficient range of temperatures for more than few minutes, and takes several hours to completely cool down (depending on the weather), so there is definitely no need to keep the car running during short errand (never mind someone could simply run off with the vehicle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any concerns about premature wear of the starting infrastructure are moot considering savings on fuel and other engine components (one could afford to replace starters every 3-4 years at the worst). See the linked posts for detailed arithmetic. And any energy losses that occur during starting, and keeping the electrical loads going during the time the engine is off are minuscule compared to energy used by petrol combustion while idling.

Total system fluid will recirculate in about 20,000l/3300 = 6 hours.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If 6 hours is acceptable then a 50 Watt pump will be adequate. That sizing was probably conservative so I'dd expect you'd actually get substantially more flow and quicker turnover than that if required. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say flow wanted = L litres/hour.&#xA; Lift from top of sump if full to grow bed = 2 feet.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; If you want to be able to pump with simp only half full = 3 feet from top, required lift = 5 feet. Say 1.5 metres.  If you want to be able to pump sump from very bottom you need more power or be willing to accept a lower flow rate (probably acceptable).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So say Lift at full flow = 1.5 metres = height = head = h&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) The easy way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pump manufacturers provide lift x volume charts and these can be used to select required power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) The slightly harder way. In your case -  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power ~~ = (litres per hour) / 66 Watts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will get about 66 litres per hour per Watt in your system.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Divide litres by ~~= 4 to get US gallons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why ?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Read on ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pump power at 100% efficiency ~= head x litres/second x 10 Watts&lt;br&gt;&#xA; litres/second = litres/hour/3600.&#xA;For system with less than 100% efficiency multiply power needed by K.&#xA;K = 100/efficiency %.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;eg 50% efficiency -&gt; k= 2.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;25% efficiency  K = 100/25 = 4 etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Power = metres lift x litres / hour * 10/3600 * k &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assume k-5 for now = 20% efficient = easily achieved.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; This includes pipeline head or pressure losses at typical flow rates. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Power = lift x litres /h x 50/3600 = h x l x 0.0139&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Close enough to start:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power = lift x litres per hour / 100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 1.5m lift Power = litres per hour / 66&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;litres per hour = 66 x Watts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="318" LastEditorUserId="318" LastEditDate="2013-03-21T10:06:59.310" LastActivityDate="2013-03-21T10:06:59.310" CommentCount="1" />

So, the answer could be yes, no or maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know about your supplier's particular plan, and in order to keep this answer useful to as many readers as possible, I'll talk about the generalities that make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Generation-specific&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most renewable sources have such low short-run marginal costs that they'll run pretty much any time, regardless of the current price in the market. So an increase in demand from consumers on renewable tariffs is very unlikely to result in immediate increase in renewable supply. There might be corner cases on small grids where the marginal producer is a renewable supplier with non-trivial short-run marginal costs, such as biomass or biogas: in such cases, increased demand from people on 100% renewable tariffs could cause an immediate and equivalent increase in renewable supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Scheme-specific&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most 100%-renewable tariffs tend to be based on the trading of certificates-of-origin of renewable electricity. Whether your tariff really makes a difference, will depend on whether or not there is a surplus of such certificates in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surplus&lt;/strong&gt;: If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a surplus, and it is expected that there will continue to be a surplus, (as is the case Britain with the REGOs - Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin) then no, the tariff makes no difference at all.

The two major sustainability questions concern the energy to produce it,  and the resource used to produce it.  Additional concerns are the difficulty to recycle/dispose of at end of life, and the costs of both moving the resource to manufacturing point, and moving the product to the use point.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AFAIK there is no general purpose definition.  Here's some comparisons and tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group 1.  Plastic/Petrochemical&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinyl&lt;/strong&gt; -- probably one of the worst picks.  All sorts of poisonous byproducts in it's manufacture, and in disposal.  Relatively innocuous in use.  Lifetime 15-25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shingle&lt;/strong&gt; -- Similar to the standard asphalt and fiber and rock shingles used on roofs, but designed to be used vertically.  Tend to last longer as siding than they do as roof, because there is no snow load, no hail, less sun.  Not terribly hard on the environment -- basically the same material as roads with glass fiber added.  As long as we are going to use fossil fuel, we will have a surplus of asphalt.  Of this group, I consdier this one most sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group 2:  Wood based.  Wood is the only fully renewable material on this list, so in that sense is the most sustainable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wood slab.&lt;/strong&gt;  Formed from the first cut off the side of a log, bark scraped off, and a half lap rabbeted on each side.  Requires new coat of log oil every 5 years or so. Very sustainable -- better use than for fuel, which is otherwise what happens to slabs. Very time consuming to put on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clapboard.&lt;/strong&gt;  Requires large trees as feed stock, and so competes with the other uses for large trees.  If Cedar clapboard is used, puts higher demand on an already high demand wood.  Requires regular painting.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tongue &amp;amp; Groove Milled siding.&lt;/strong&gt;  Similar to clapboard but both thicker and narrower.  Can be made with smaller trees.  Uses more wood overall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chip based siding&lt;/strong&gt; -- Made from slash and scrap wood. Requires regular painting. Requires significant petrochemical resins to bond the chips together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group 3 Metal based. Metal siding requires careful attention to the details around doors and windows.  It also has zero water permiability, so some form of ventilation or rain screen needs to be behind the siding. Metal siding usually won't require care once up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum siding.  High initial embodied energy cost, but will last a very very long time.  Subject to dents.  Aluminum recycles quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steel siding.  Lower energy than aluminum, but also lower lifetime.  Better dent resistance.    Also endlessly recyclable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Group 4.  Cementaceous based siding.  Relatively high emboddied energy, and low recycleability.  Used material is only good for fill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portland cement and fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Portland cement is one of the highest energy materials out there -- a significant amount of our cultures total energy budget is spent making portland cement.  In that sense it's unsustainnable.  The raw material is limestone, and we have whole mountains made of it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fiber can be one of several minerals, indlcuding asbestos, serpentine, rock wool from slag, spun glass from recycled glass.  Coloring can be either embedded mineral pigments, or painted.  If embedded will last a very long time.  Essentially impossible to recycle -- use as fill.  Note that it requires a lab test to determine if the fiber component is asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lime/Earth Plaster:&lt;/strong&gt;  See any resource on strawbale building.  The energy cost of lime is much smaller than for portland cement, and earth based is just clay and fine sand.  However the usual use is with buildings with wide eaves to reduce the amount of rain hitting them.  They are very labour intensive to apply, and require attention to maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stucco:&lt;/strong&gt;  Relatively cheap, long lasting, but very limited in available colours.  While it can be painted, it seldom is.  Stucco housing developments tend to be grey and dreary looking. Stucco is also based on portland cement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, My opinion is that the wood slab siding is the most sustainable.  The resource is renewable, the energy costs moderate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second on my list are the lime/earth based plasters if you have a house/climate that allow it. Stucco comes close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third on my list is steel siding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A better answer than this would require  deciding which factors are most important, as well as energy and resource use of the particular product and manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate sustainable action is to do nothing.  It requires no energy, no resources.  If the present siding works and is not harming you while present, the the most sustainable siding is the present siding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Original Answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, it's not a health concern.  Right now it's locked up as siding.  If you remove it, you will break it up, make dust, which IS a health problem, but sitting there bonded to concrete on the side of your house it is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep it painted to keep dust from spalling off of it. although that is a pretty minor concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even asbestos insulation is largely harmless once in place.  The hazard is in working around it, with it, but asbestos bonded into tile or cement siding is reasonably safe unless some process is turning it into powder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="400" LastEditorUserId="400" LastEditDate="2013-03-26T14:42:11.967" LastActivityDate="2013-03-26T14:42:11.967" CommentCount="0" />

The basis for the claim can be seen in various sources but it is arguably not justified as a pithy one line summary of the factors that drive Danish wind power installations in and leading up to 2000. Read on ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original &quot;Energy 81&quot; incentive set targets and these were adjusted along the way by agreement and negotiation between government and industry. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The refence in (2) below gives a reasonably blow-by-blow description of the timing and nature of major relevant incentives. Repowering is not mentioned per se but you can easily see where it might fit in to such a program, laden with incentives to do new better things, create jobs, meet increased performance targets etc. Note the electricity production support scheme described as &quot;only for gas from 2000&quot; - that sounds like a very major reason to get any qualifying wind turbine work completed BY 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) This UK Tyndal Centre report gives a reasonable brief summary of the issues and processes and timetables involved.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wp76.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of political uncertainty in the Danish renewable energy market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of significance is their comment about per turbine capacities. The original legislation was framed with both total megawatt capacity and turbine count targets in mind. The growth in per-turbine capacity was not anticipated originally and repowering was a consequence of the better economics achievable by obtaining more power (and energy) from a given site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their section 2.1 notes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first target for the deployment of wind power is found in Energy 81: 60,000 windmills to supply 10% of electricity by 2000. In 1990 a program was introduced to build 100MW of wind (Gronheit, 2002). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1996 the government and utilities signed an agreement for the installation of&#xA;200 MW. Utilities were already responsible for a target of 1,500 MW by 2005.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;However, at the end of 2000 almost 2,300 MW wind capacity had been already installed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that in 1997 the number of turbines was under 5,000, i.e. far below the target introduced in Energy 81. The increased size of turbines had not been forecasted by the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1998 utilities signed an agreement to install 750 MW offshore wind turbine before 2008. According to government’s forecast, these turbines would generate 10% of the electricity consumption. The agreement is considered the first phase of a total 4,000 MW installation before 2030. According to reports from the Ministry of Environment, the capacity for offshore wind is 12,000 MW or 30-40 TWh in generation terms (DEA, 2002). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Here is a summary of key Danish legislative steps along the way from about 1990.

The first target can be found in Decree Energy 81: the installation of 60,000 windmills to supply 10% of the electricity demand by 2000, a target that had already been reached in 1998 with fewer than 5000 turbines (Agnolucci, 2007). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the early 1990s, a second target was announced by the government, namely to build 100 MW of wind power capacity, while in 1996 the utilities and the government signed a target agreement to install 1500 MW by 2005.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, at the end of 2000, 2300 MW had already been installed (Agnolucci, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2012 -  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ens.dk/Documents/Netboghandel%20-%20publikationer/2013/Energy%20Policy%20in%20Denmark.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Energy policy in Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2006 - &lt;a href=&quot;http://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gwec-2006_final_01.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Global wind report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wind power in Denmark - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://incoteco.com/upload/CIEN.158.2.66.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why wind power works for Denmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/reports/Pure_Power_III.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wind targets for Europe 2020, 2030&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;============================&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;re&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: The aim of repowering is to make better use of wind resources on existing sites. Older sites can be &quot;fully populated&quot; by turbines in the 100's of kW range such that no new turbines can be installed. By replacing existing turbines with fewer much larger turbines with much higher mean heights an increased amount of energy can be intercepted for the same site area. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The picture below is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/wind/europe-replaces-old-wind-farms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Europe Replaces Old Wind Farms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The amazingly similar [tm] cloud formations indicates that this is a conceptual rather than actual &quot;after&quot; example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They say: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Photo-illustration: Bundesverband WindEnergie.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A wind farm at Simonsberg, in northern Germany, would produce more electricity with just a few large turbines than it does with many small ones.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/rBL8Z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FCN Working Paper No. 19/2011&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Repowering of Wind Turbines: Economics and Optimal Timing&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sebastian Himpler and Reinhard Madlener&lt;br&gt;&#xA;November 2011 Revised July 2012&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Institute for Future Energy Consumer Needs and Behavior (FCN)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;School of Business and Economics / E.ON ERC  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="318" LastEditorUserId="318" LastEditDate="2013-03-25T13:12:50.880" LastActivityDate="2013-03-25T13:12:50.880" CommentCount="0" />

Treatment facilities are designed to remove bacterial and viral contaminants, not solid wastes (grinding it and sending it into the sewer system does not change the fact that it is solid waste).  Most plants have been retrofitted to remove the increased volume of food waste (among other things), but it is no where near as efficient as composting this waste stream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, using a garbage disposal is another way to outsource waste removal without paying additionally for it, and it puts an undue burden on infrastructure.  To see this process in action, and to see what happens when food waste is co-mingled with wastewater, I highly recommend taking a tour of your local treatment facility - usually this is a free service provided to citizens.  For example, if you live in southern California, the Orange County Sanitation District and Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts will offer free tours:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocsd.com/index.aspx?page=115&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orange County Sanitation District&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacsd.org/education/tours/default.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Los Angeles County Sanitation District&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composting is relatively easy, although it does require a bit of maintenance.  If you have a backyard, outdoor composting is definitely the preferred solution - there are plenty of websites out there that will provide instructions.  If you live in an apartment or have limited space, consider worm composting.  If done properly, there is no odor, and the end product (worm casting &quot;poo&quot;) makes for perfect potting soil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composting (as above) should only be done with specific kinds of scraps - e.g. fruits, veggies, breads, egg shells, garden cuttings, etc.  Do NOT add fats, oils, meats, or dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of guinea pigs as a disposal method - cool idea!

Nevertheless, in a few cases, mainly lithium, extraction from seawater could provide amounts of metals sufficient for closing the cycle of metal use in the economy, provided that an increased level of recycling can be attained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;strong&gt;Ref1:&lt;/strong&gt;   This excellent paper discusses the issues involved and provides details of attempts to extract Uranium and Lithium. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4558&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mining the Oceans: Can We Extract Minerals from Seawater?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ugo Bardi - September 22, 2008&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Website: The Oil Drum: Europe   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An image in Ref1 shows Japanese researchers investigating Uranium extraction!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They say - &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four most concentrated metal ions, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+, are the only ones commercially extractable today, with the the least concentrated of the four being potassium (K) at 400 parts per million (ppm).   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below potassium, we go down to lithium, which has never been extracted in commercial amounts from seawater, with a concentration of 0.17 ppm.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other dissolved metal ions exist at lower concentrations, sometimes several orders of magnitude lower.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;None has ever been commercially extracted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A company set up in New Zealand a decade + ago to do Lithium extraction.

The science of this is still new.  Stay tuned.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other possibilities.  Fertilizing the oceans with iron comes up, but I don't think we understand oceanic ecology well enough.  It would be a bitch to measure progress.  At least with charcoal and trees, we can make good estimates of how much carbon is there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The power plant near my home looked at a pilot plant for extract CO2 from the exhaust stream, and storing it underground.  It looked like a 10% cost in plant efficiency, and a large increase in plant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You asked about costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40562.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40562.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;cites cost ranging from 200 to 2000 dollars per acre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forest biomass:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0717-forest_carbon.html&quot;&gt;http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0717-forest_carbon.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;cites an average of 377 tons/acre averaged across 18 sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you are willing to wait,  the cost is somewhere between 50 cents and 5 bucks per ton. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the 10% efficiency loss for CO2 separation at the power plant and deep well injection is correct, then since a state of the art coal plant is about 45% efficient, it would increase the cost of power by 45/35.  Your ton of coal produces 240 kWh at 3c or about $7.20  This would raise the price by around $2.  Now the separation process is only about 70% efficient.  (Making it more efficent makes the power plant less so.)  So first order ballpark cost is around $3 per ton of carbon.  It would be lower for natural gas and oil fired plants since they get more energy per ton of carbon.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The charcoal sequesterization, if a workable system can be made, actually MAKES money.  Many crops produce enough residual plant matter that what to do with it is an issue.  Not all of it can be used for feed, and all too often growers will bale it just to get it off their field.  Significant amounts are burned in outside furnaces to provide heat for livestock sheds, shops, etc.  It &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a simple redesign to make charcoal makers, which would get only half the heat per bale, but produces charcoal as a byproduct.  The farmer wins with more productive fields as he works this into his land, mostly showing up as decreased fertilizer cost, fewer crop failures, and higher production -- maybe.  Quantifying this is difficult to impossible because we are at the cutting edge of soil science with carbon.  It will also be a tough initial sell.  I would expect a charcoal maker to be 2-4 times as expensive to make as a bale burner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a process that will work with a lot of municipal waste too that would otherwise fill landfills.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="400" LastEditorUserId="400" LastEditDate="2013-03-29T15:01:28.967" LastActivityDate="2013-03-29T15:01:28.967" CommentCount="5" />

Most of the disolved minerals are present in very small numbers.  You are going to have to process cubic km of water.  I suspect that the only way to do this economically is to develop materials that bind to a particular atom or ion, coat fabric with it, and let the currents go past it.  For perspective the larger open pit mines have total volumes measured in a small number of cubic kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Factor 2:  To gather material at a level that would make a measurable decrease in the mineral content, you would have to process a measurable fraction of the ocean.  Suppose that you decided to mine the Gulf stream.  So you intercept a 300 km wide strip of ocean 100 m deep.  The gulf stream moves at about 4 mph -- 6 kph say.  So your system will intercept 180 cubic kilometers of water per hour.  At that rate it would take you 7 million hours (about 8 centuries) to process the entire ocean once.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Factor 3:  Replenishment processes.  Most minerals are not close to saturation.  Common salt, the most common mineral, is present at about 3%.  Saturation for salt is about 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be some exchange between sea floor sediment, but this is going to be VERY slow.   Turnover times for the abyssal plain are on the order of 10,000 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the primary replenishment processes will be geological -- erosion.  If this is correct, then you would do far better by filtering the rivers as they flow to the sea, mining our cities sewage (meta content thousands of times higher than in sea water)  ANY technology that can extract useful minerals out of sea water can extract them out of any liquid waste stream, with likely far greater efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intercepting significant amounts of an ocean current will have climate effects.  People in nothern Europe will NOT be pleased with you if you slow down the Gulf stream by 10%  Slowing it down, also means that the temperature differential between the tropics and the pole will increase giving greater potential energy to hurricanes.  You just picked up another hate group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caveats:  Even now vacuuming up manganese nodules off the ocean floor is worth while.

There's a lot of oil in places that we can't easily reach right now. As oil reserves are consumed, the price of oil increases (simple supply and demand). Counter-intuitively, as the price of oil increases, the amount of oil reserves has historically &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt;.  This is because the oil that was previously not considered recoverable can now be extracted because drilling technology has advanced and the higher price-per-barrel makes it more economical to extract that hard-to-reach oil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the more oil we use, the more the price of oil increases, and the more oil we can afford to extract at the new, higher prices. We're now seeing production of oil from tar sands, which is much more difficult and expensive than extraction from a conventional well. We will continue to see production of harder (and more expensive) to reach oil reserves as the price increases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when drilling for oil, not all of the oil is actually extracted. The faster you extract oil the less you get out, and it's never possible to extract &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the oil. This is referred to as the upper technically recoverable and economically recoverable amount, and gives the probability of extracting a particular volume of oil from a certain oil field. This image shows a generic example, showing the difference between what's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to recover and what's &lt;em&gt;economical&lt;/em&gt; to recover:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-0028-01/fs-0028-01.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/6bZV3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;oil recoverability curve&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it becomes increasingly difficult to find new oil sources, I expect we will see advancements in technology (and in the amount of money oil companies are willing to invest) to go back to &quot;finished&quot; wells and extract oil that wasn't previously extractable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now obviously, oil is a finite resource. It will technically run out eventually, but it won't be like hitting a brick wall. It'll be an overall increase in cost and decrease in availability over the next 20, 50, maybe 100-200 years. Depending on who you ask, there are about 0.8-1.5 trillion barrels of recoverable oil left in conventional reserves worldwide&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2178rank.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;. At a current consumption rate of about 90 million barrels of oil per day&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/report/global_oil.cfm&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, that would put us right about at 30 years before current reserves run out. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;, that doesn't take into account unconventional sources, future advancements in extraction technology, and the production in the future of sources not presently considered recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/report/global_oil.cfm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/aPHD6.png&quot; alt=&quot;world oil supply chart&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What are the alternatives for energy?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you said, petroleum does seem the most likely to disappear, or at least become economically unfeasible to continue using the soonest. Coal and natural gas are the other major fossil fuels, and we have quite a bit of both. From a sustainability perspective, natural gas is preferable to oil and coal: it's relatively clean to burn from an air pollution perspective, and while still emitting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when burned, it does emit less carbon than other fossil fuel sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have quite a bit of natural gas and coal left - especially coal. The US Energy Information Administration estimates there are about 483 billion short tons of coal reserves in the US alone&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/coal/reserves/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;. In terms of raw energy content, that's the equivalent of about 2 trillion barrels of oil&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28coal%20energy%20content%20%2a%20483%20billion%20short%20tons%29%20/%20BOE&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the US has at least twice as much energy in coal as the whole world does in oil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coal is obviously unsustainable. It's a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and the extraction process is environmentally devastating. You're right that we won't run out of coal anytime soon, but it's not a good alternative to oil (although &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_liquefaction&quot;&gt;coal liquifaction&lt;/a&gt; is a real technology that we may see more of in the future).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We really don't need to use oil for electricity or heat generation. Other technologies are much better for those tasks. It's very difficult to replace oil for transportation though, because almost nothing is as energy dense and portable as petroleum products. Biofuels have the potential to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;, but have their own sustainability challenges and often use more fossil fuels in the production process than they save. Next-generation biofuels based on cellulosic feedstocks and microbial/algal production have potential as well, but it is unlikely that we'll replace our entire petroleum-based transportation system with biofuels - we simply don't have the land to do it. Battery technology is improving, and we'll likely see a gradual shift to electric vehicles as they become more practical. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there will also be some necessary lifestyle changes to move away from oil as a transportation fuel. There will come a point - be it sooner or later - when petroleum is simply too expensive for us to continue our current lifestyle without changes. Whether the change is to electric vehicles, greater use of public transportation, more active transit (walking, biking, etc.) or something else is something we have yet to see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What are the alternatives for plastics?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a plastics expert, although I am friends with a few. We can make plastics from plants, and have been for some time - those biodegradable plastics you see sometimes are made from corn. Bio-plastics are an up-and-coming research area, but as with energy, we won't be able to keep up our current level of consumption with bio-replacements alone. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plastics recycling is a tricky situation right now, and we're going to see a lot more recycling in the near future. Companies have developed technology that can take waste plastics (unsorted of any type) and break them back down into crude oil to be reprocessed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilyx.com/our-technology/&quot;&gt;(5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This avoids the hassle of separating plastic types (which is a major disincentive for recycling in the eyes of many people today), and provides greater flexibility for the end product. A combination of bio-plastics and plastics recycling may help alleviate these problems in the future, but plastics likely will get more expensive at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="317" LastActivityDate="2013-03-31T02:51:43.783" CommentCount="2" />

The problem is that oil, coal and gas all get double-subsidies, globally. Firstly, they get explicit financial subsidies from many governments.

I suggest this has to do with Jones accounting of indirect supply chain emissions he calculated using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eiolca.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lifecycle input output analysis&lt;/a&gt;, so I tend to trust his figures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es102221h&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;paper Jones published&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Science and Technology showed, using the same methodologies, that these distributions can vary substantially.  For instance, a comparison of San Francisco vs St. Louis showed the following differences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;transportation emissions 2x as high in SF compared to SL&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;housing emissions over 2x as high in SL compared to SF&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;food emissions twice as high in SL compared to SF&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;goods emissions ~30% higher in SF compared to SL&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;service emissions ~40% higher in SF compared to SL&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because I'm not sure which locations you are choosing between, I can't say what categories will be most important to you, so I'll use the average US case.  Based on Jones' analysis we see that transportation, electricity and heating are good place to start to look at reducing your carbon impact.  The first consideration you should therefore make is your traveling habits at the two different places:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As a retired person will you be traveling on vacation a lot?  Using&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/documents/resources/commute_travel_product.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EPA Climate Leaders'&lt;/a&gt; figures, we can crudely estimate that a 6000 mi flight * .185 kg / passenger-mi results in over one metric ton of direct CO2 emissions&amp;nbsp;— roughly 10% of the average American's direct transportation emissions&amp;nbsp;— not insignificant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What will your daily commute look like?  If you're staying at home wiping the grand kids' ass then score some points for sustainability!  However, if you are going to need to drive your car for entertainment, volunteering, work in either situation, you'll need to exploit opportunities to carpool or use a low emission vehicle (think electric with solar).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What will the building situation look like?  If you can't directly compare electric and heating bills, consider the natural lighting, the climate (a more extreme climate leads to increased HVAC loads), insulation and air leakiness of the house.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now more specific to your question, let's hold these factors constant and just consider how adding an additional person to a house can contribute to sustainability.  Every four years the EIA conducts a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption#summary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;residential energy consumer survey&lt;/a&gt;.  Now here is some data I love and think would be very interesting to you  (there is a bunch of other great stuff in there for any data junkies):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/blWi7.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are substantial energy savings from increasing the number of members per household. However &lt;em&gt;there are diminishing returns&lt;/em&gt; to adding another member to the house.  So the first person would contribute 30% per capita energy savings, the second 20%, the third 10%.  This is important from a macro-perspective.  Let's say you have 30 people and developers are considering design occupancy.  The improvement from going from six 5-person units to five 6-person units is not as significant as moving from fifteen 2-person units to ten 3-person units.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From your perspective as an individual (or couple), there will be significant advantages to living in 5+ person house compared to a house for one or two people.  Let's say you are considering a two person house vs a six person house.  Moving into the two person house, you would be responsible for 50% of the 2-person house's primary energy (45 MBtu).  If you were the sixth person in a five person house, you would be responsible for 4MBtu margin of going from 5 person to six person house.  &lt;strong&gt;A huge difference!&lt;/strong&gt;  These gains are mostly from shared energy sources, such as a refrigerator, shared lighting, shared air temperature etc.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously energy consumption is very different outside US, but the principles should hold. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="404" LastEditorUserId="1000" LastEditDate="2013-12-29T14:52:22.063" LastActivityDate="2013-12-29T14:52:22.063" CommentCount="2" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-04-02T02:48:06.533" />

So far. For good reason.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They MAY come. but not soon, and not easily.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; BUT energy production as a whole is potentially moving towards the model suggested in the question. Whether it gets there depends on many factors ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As much as we all may like to see a numerous and increasing number of &quot;breeder&quot; projects the reality so far is that the only ones that appear to exist turn out to so far be only theoretical and &quot;on paper&quot;. Their day is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall such systems do exist on a larger scale but they are interleaved through industry as a whole. That is, rather than having identifiable stand alone systems that self-grow we instead have an industrial society whose energy production capability is increasing and which uses its own energy production to drive this increase. So far this increase is driven by energy from mixed sources - both renewable and non renewable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of renewable energy sources providing an increasing proportion of total energy production - and so approaching the ideal suggested by the questioner, increases with time due to eg &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our capabilities grow the ability to get more energy per land area from windfarms, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing efficiencies from solar photovoltaic while using thinner lower material content PV cells. (eg until recently state of the art industrial PV crystalline silicon panels were about 18% efficient but recent back contact cells with improved antireflective methods have resulted in 23%+ efficient commercially available PV cells. Efficiency improvement allows higher energy per area, less maintenance costs from eg cleaning, better land utilisation. Silicon material availability is not usually a primary issue but thinner cells improve yields and allow new variants such as flexible crystalline silicon - double side irradiation etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer life higher efficiency solar thermal plants with eg molten salt heat storage to extend operating hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercialisation of dish-Stirling systems with best in class efficiencies in excess of that so far achievable by solar PV. (Commercially viable Solar dish Stirling has been  a decades long journey which even now is at the marginal stage. )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these and others will slowly push up the the potential proportion of renewable energy in the global energy mix. However, the massive increasaes in petroleum availability on the last decade or so due to &quot;Fracking&quot; developments and the incipient potential for eg coal recovery by fluid flow methods and the massive potential for deep sea Methane Hydrate recovery also means that the renewable proportion of total energy produced may fall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Breeder reactor methods, and the long long long proposed Thorium &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pebble Bed reactor&lt;/a&gt;  technology while not fully renewable, greatly increases nuclearfuel utilisation.

There are many who argue that there is no net energy gain available in current alternative energy systems such as biomass where long term energy out is said not to match total system wide energy expenditure. eg for biomass energy is expended on planting, harvesting, transportation, processing, storage, waste disposal etc. To make biomass products such as transport alcohol viable subsidies are usually required. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting carefully that all energy sources that we can access are in some manner area based on &quot;star stuff&quot; at root. Our own Star &quot;Sol&quot; drives wind, hydro, PV, solar thermal, coal and more. Other stars have sourced radioactives. Everything above iron appears to have come from Supernovae. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that that out whole existent infrastructure worldwide is already based on a solar driven breeder system. You may need to refine your assumptions or conditions to eliminate some aspects which are not desired.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One  obvious questionable point is the use of hydrocarbons obtained by &quot;mining&quot; in some way or another (drill, dig, Frac ...). These energy sources are repositories of stored solar energy - but &quot;we&quot; did not do the storing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another questionable source is radioactives. These also are &quot;star stuff&quot; - but not from our current nearby Star. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole of life energy cost of a product can be VERY roughly approximated by expressing its best available initial cost in energy cost terms. eg you can buy PV solar material in vast volume in China for approaching $US0.10/Watt_mp and whole made up panels at around $US0.50 ex factory. This must be more than the cost energy of fabrication IF government or other subsidies are not present. In fact, Chinese solar manufacturing is crucially dependant on state subsidy at present so overall it is likely that PV panels bought in vast volume cost around or even slightly less than the energy cost of production - and that the lifetime energy available from these systems will be somewhat higher than this but not vastly so.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A look at real world solar PV realities is not encouraging. eg  1000 Wmp of PV panels costs about $US400 FOB factory at present in large volume.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The installed cost of such a sytem in a &quot;western location&quot; is around $1/Watt mp.&lt;br&gt;&#xA; In a good location mean daily output is about 4 kWh and for a say 20 year design life total energy produced = 4 kWh x 365 days x 20 years =~ 30 MWh.  AT $US0.10 wholesale / kWh that's $2920 of electricity for $1000 of installed panel cost over 20 years. At first glance that's a win. However, if you include &quot;cost of money&quot; = which you must, then a simple DCF calculation suggests about $1960 at 5%, $1400 at 10% and $1100 at 15%.&#xA;At $1/Wmp installed break even is barely reached at 15% - a rate that international financiers of large risky project are liable to expect. Even at 5% the profit of about $900/kW of panels is required to also fund maintenance, cleaning. a significant factor, any early failures and decommissioning. $900 is $45 / year per kW of panels including any profit. That's about 6 square metres of panel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If any one energy source was vastly more cost effective it would dominate world markets and displace alternatives. At present coal, hydro, geothermal are king, nuclear is a special case and the &quot;wannabees&quot; are wind &amp;amp; waves (both a form of solar) and PV &amp;amp; thermal solar. I say nuclear is a special case as all insurance risk has always been underwritten by governments in all installations anywhere, no private insurer will tough the market with a triple length barge pole and in an open market the product could not be sold, no matter how &quot;truly safe&quot; it was. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While wind and various solar sources are being used in competition with traditional sources they are invariably assisted by various special tariffs or market distortions or enforced special rates or conditions. Its still hard to compete head on with energetic gooey stuff found for free (initially) in the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, so far, if you can build an escalating self-replicating infrastructure with traditional energy sources, then you can probably do so with &quot;alternate&quot; sources, but it will be harder, or much harder. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is a work of fiction, Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy + &quot;Red Mars&quot;, &quot;Green Mars&quot;, Blue Mars&quot; contains many ideas in the ability to build a world starting with small seed input. He use nuclear, solar, thermal and more on a grand scale. A very worthwhile read from many perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Energy numbers asked:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I've read this correctly, you're claiming that the economics implies that PV has an EROEI of only just above 1, or below it. And in comparing wind with fossil fuel subsidies, you've ignored the subsidies and externalities of fossil fuels. Have I understood correctly? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; @EnergyNumbers Close enough, alas. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can add in fossil fuel etc subsidies as may esist if you wish, but on a level playing field the raw concentrated &amp;amp; stored energy of petroleum makes it hard to compete with. The cost of petroleum is essentially extraction + transport + refining + profit + taxes. You do not largely need to &quot;interact&quot; with the energy source per se and the energy per volume is high these both  make the job cheaper and easier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've added to my answer above with some rough figures for solar. The &quot;trouble&quot; with existing energy sources is that we have tapped the obvious easy ones. Liquid hydrocarbons (petrol, diesel, kerosine) give around 10 kWh/kg or say about 2.5 kWh/kg delivered energy in an internal combustion engine system. Coal delivers lower energy/kg but is still extremely energy dense compared to non chemical-stored-energy alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Falling mass (water or whatever) delivers 10 Watt.seconds per kg.metre&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But to equal the delivered energy from 1 kg of hydrocarbon takes&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2500 Watt hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 9,000,000 Watt seconds !!! of energy.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This takes 900 ton.metres of falling mass at 100%. ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put another way&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1 ton = 1000 kg falling 10 metres&lt;br&gt;&#xA;delivers 100,000 Watt.seconds = 27.777.. Watt hours of energy.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or 1 kg/second falling 10 metres in one second&lt;br&gt;&#xA;delivers 100 Watts at 100% efficient,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but do that for one hour = 36,000 litres or 36 tons of water to get about 1% of the energy in 1 kg of petroleum (or 4% of delivered energy in auto use). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AND hydro is &quot;easy and cheap&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We know that PV needs subsidies / FITs etc to compete.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And that eg the Chinese government are essentially subsidising ALL the still surviving Chinese PV makers makers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;problem&quot; is that we value energy at the hydrocarbon equivalent value to our society and until we are willing to bite the &quot;pay what it really costs&quot; bullet alternatives will remain marginal or of negative value. Alas. &#xA;[[FWIW: I design/make small solar products, manufactured in China (at present) for developing country use. So I watch what solar and similar costs and where it is going. So, sometime. But not yet. Despite what the downvoter may think :-). ]].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that people in the US who cover their roof with PV usually are happy with the payback. The feed in tariffs, purchase subsidies and lack of costed labor for eg panel cleaning, mean that they may get $ for $ break even in the 5 to 10 years range.But add some discounted cash flow cost-of money calculations and take away the various subsidies (including those by the Chinese government) and you find that PV are at best fighting neck and neck with traditional systems when areas of good sunshine are available, or losing out in real terms. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thorium Pebble Bed - &quot;not quite renewable /  cheaper than coal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pebblebedreactor.blogspot.co.nz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://pebblebedreactor.blogspot.co.nz/&lt;/a&gt;           &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoriumenergycheaperthancoal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thoriumenergycheaperthancoal.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://singularityhub.com/2012/12/11/norway-begins-four-year-test-of-thorium-nuclear-reactor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Norway 4 year Thorium power trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9784044/China-blazes-trail-for-clean-nuclear-power-from-thorium.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;China Thorium power &lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=thorium+reactor&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=-rpeUdHXFdGyiQf0moHAAg&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CFwQsAQ&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=720#hl=en&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;q=thorium+reactor+pebble+bed&amp;amp;oq=thorium+reactor+pebble+bed&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3...226776.229953.0.230188.11.11.0.0.0.0.248.1691.5j0j6.11.0...0.0...1c.1.8.img.JXE6k3-ayZQ&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;amp;bvm=bv.44770516,d.aGc&amp;amp;fp=80a3200bb8b7bcb6&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=720&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thorium Pebble Bed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75393281/Pebble-Bed-Reactors-for-Once-Trough-Nuclear-Transmutation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coal2nuclear.com/ss_skyscrubber_pilot.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coal power station + thorium PBR + CO2 capture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/68006457/The-Pebble-Bed-Modular-Reactor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independentaustralia.net/2013/environment/dont-believe-thorium-nuclear-reactor-hype/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ANTI-Thrium argument5s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2006/10/a-nuclear-reactor-in-every-home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A nuclear reactor in every home&lt;/a&gt; Hookey Walker   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="318" LastEditorUserId="318" LastEditDate="2013-04-06T12:18:14.363" LastActivityDate="2013-04-06T12:18:14.363" CommentCount="9" />

Permaculturalists also eat the young leaves cooked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think yield of nuts is the only issue.  The other issues must include long-term soil issues and the like.  While higher yields can in theory support larger populations, that's only one long-term variable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, nuts are probably more sustainable as a class than beans because beans are typically grown as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_species&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pioneer species&lt;/a&gt; on disturbed soil while nuts are grown as longish term trees.  While beans fix nitrogen, the fact that they are pioneer species works against them in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why permaculturalists disfavor pioneer species for long-term sustainability is that they grow in disturbed soil, which requires ploughing, and this leads to both depletion of nutrients and erosion of soil.  This requires strategies for mitigating both pests nutrient depletion.  Trees are considered more sustainable because they represent an ecological niche closer to the apex of ecological succession and are thus can be grown in ways which require, long term, far fewer inputs.  Of course this is only one factor and how the trees are grown is critically important too.

With cashews, the &quot;apples&quot; can be cooked and eaten (mildly astringent fruit resembling the Indonesian jambu air).  with walnuts, the wood is useful  We don't use as much hazelwood as we used to (it's good for bows and for tally sticks).

In this way I incorporate smallish amounts of more risky foods (like cooked veggies) underneath the mulch, between the mulch and the soil.  I find that if I do this, it decomposes fast and the sorts of animals attracted tend to be small decomposers like centipedes, ants, and earthworms.

Other approaches might include plastic composters, covered piles, vermipost, or the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always pest management is very local so what works for me may not work for you.

I'll try to address some more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Battery End-of-Life&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question is obviously referring to &lt;strong&gt;standard&lt;/strong&gt; car batteries, which are used to power the car's starter motor.  These are generally lead-acid batteries.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A true Electric Vehicle (EV) may have a small battery just like this (e.g. to drive accesories), but this kind of battery is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what drives the car, and is not the big impact on the recycling/landfill issue.  An EV's traction motor will probably use a NiMH or Li-ion battery pack.  It's very large, and very expensive.  It also happens to be about 85% recyclable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My 2011 Nissan LEAF has a 24 KWh capacity Li-ion battery pack in it.  At this point, it's hard to tell exactly what the longevity will be, because it's a new product.  However, automakers do test these things before fielding new models (the results are obviously important when they decide what kind of warranties to offer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nissan projects the life of this battery pack to be 10 years.  What does that mean?  By their definition, at the end of 10 years of life, it will have a useful capacity that's 70-80% of its original capacity, depending on how you use it.  So, by no means is the battery &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt;.  But, they're estimating what a user would be willing to tolerate in terms of driving range reduction.  If your trips tend to be 20 miles or less, or you have recharge facilities at your typical destination (e.g. workplace charging), then you may continue to use your 10 year-old batteries.  But, 10 years seems like a reasonable longevity estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the bigger a battery is (all else equal), the more likely you can recycle it, and even get paid to do so.  As I said, a Li-ion battery is largely recyclable, and with 70-80% capacity, even still usable for non-automotive energy storage applications.  It's &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; hard to believe that a battery pack that originally cost &lt;a href=&quot;http://green.autoblog.com/2010/05/15/nissan-leaf-profitable-by-year-three-battery-cost-closer-to-18/&quot;&gt;several thousand dollars&lt;/a&gt;, that still has 70% capacity, and is 85% recyclable, wouldn't fetch a significant trade-in value.  This value will likely ensure that EV batteries are not simply thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Energy Efficiency / Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As EnergyNumbers said, the overall energy efficiency of an EV depends highly on &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the electricity came from.  &lt;strong&gt;However, whether it's more environmentally friendly than standard gas internal combustion engines (ICE) does not.&lt;/strong&gt;  Even if all the car's electricity comes from coal, which is our dirtiest source of electricity, an EV is about 25% more energy efficient than a gas ICE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf&quot;&gt;From this Union of Concerned Scientists report&lt;/a&gt;, the average midsize gas ICE fuel economy is 26 mpg.  Based largely on the (midsize) Nissan LEAF, the EV well-to-wheels equivalent energy economy is 30 mpg&lt;sub&gt;ghg&lt;/sub&gt;.  So, that's already a 15% improvement for the 100% coal-powered EV.  However, a gas ICE's fuel economy is not rated &lt;em&gt;well-to-wheels&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like electricity, gas requires energy to make.  Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usda.gov/oce/reports/energy/EnergyLifeCycleSoybeanBiodieseI6-11.pdf&quot;&gt;gas and petro-diesel average an &lt;em&gt;energy ratio&lt;/em&gt; of about 0.8 to 0.9&lt;/a&gt;, which means that to produce a gallon of gas, you have to spend about .1 to .2 gallons to make it.  For Saudi oil, it takes relatively little energy to produce.  However, as that runs out, and we continue to get more gas/diesel from deepwater rigs, and tar sands oil, gas and diesel will become even more costly (and environmentally damaging) to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, when you perform well-to-wheels accounting, an EV &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; at about 25% better than a gasoline ICE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; a well-publicized &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/advanced-vehicle-technologies/electric-cars/emissions-and-charging-costs-electric-cars.html&quot;&gt;report has recently been released&lt;/a&gt;, that found Toyota Prius to be more GHG friendly than Nissan LEAF in most US states (accounting for where each state gets power from).  However, it's important to note that the Prius has a lower drag coefficient than LEAF (0.25 vs 0.28), which will increase energy economy, but is unrelated to the cars' powertrains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how environmentally-friendly &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think EVs are, but yes, they are more environmentally friendly than standard gas engine cars, in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll try to post more here as I get time ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="486" LastEditorUserId="486" LastEditDate="2013-04-22T05:23:33.613" LastActivityDate="2013-04-22T05:23:33.613" />

You can't create energy from nothing, and no process is perfectly energy efficient.  In order to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; an animal from food, first you have to grow, process, and transport the food.  The animal has to eat it and process the food into energy, which it does not do with perfect efficiency.  Then, the animal has to live for a while (weeks, months, or years, depending on the meat), during which time it has to move around, eat, poop, heat itself and make noise.  All these things take energy.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of performing this cycle, skip the animal altogether and just grow (non-animal) food that can be directly consumed by humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How inefficient it is to eat meat depends on the animal, what you feed it, and the processes used.  So, there's no one answer here.  But, a reasonable range, for example, might be that in order to produce a given unit of beef energy (e.g. a &lt;em&gt;calorie&lt;/em&gt;), you have to put in 6 to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;50 times that much energy&lt;/a&gt; in the process.  That puts the effective energy efficiency of the process at between 2% and 16%.  That's terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it gets worse.  The previous figures only discussed &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; efficiency.  If you believe that climate change is a problem, you should understand that not all greenhouse gases are equally &lt;em&gt;potent&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Methane is 22x more &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; at trapping heat in the atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; than is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the animals we get our meat from produce a lot of methane, meaning that their contribution to global warming is even worse than suggested by looking at their energy efficiency alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, don't eat meat (cow, pig, sheep, deer, etc.) in the first place.  Poultry (chicken, turkey) is a bit better.  Seafood is better still.  A vegetarian or vegan diet is most sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;If You Do Eat Meat, Don't Compost It&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As had been said many times on this site, including in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/174/486&quot;&gt;Chris's answer&lt;/a&gt;, sustainability choices should be prioritized to reduce use first, then reuse second, then recycle last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why do you have &lt;strong&gt;extra&lt;/strong&gt; meat at all?  If you have leftover meat, then buy a smaller cut.  Virtually everywhere I see meat sold allows you to buy pieces in an almost continuous array of sizes.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the developing world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/the-conundrum-of-food-waste/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;currently about 1/3 of food is lost&lt;/a&gt;, mostly to disease or spoilage (lack of preservatives, but also refrigeration).  However, in the developed world, the loss is almost exactly the same (1/3), for different reasons.  One reason is people buying and preparing more food than they need, and just throwing the rest out (or composting it).  If you need to eat 2000 calories per day, then prepare 2000 calories.  Don't prepare 2500, and then compost the unused portion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in the scenario where you can't find a way to stop eating meat, you try to buy the right-sized portion, but you still have leftovers, then save the edible meat for tomorrow.  Chop it up to make a lunch sandwich.  If you still have fat and gristle left, those things probably won't break down quickly in your compost bin, and can create health/rodent concerns outlined in other answers.  Just bury the fat in a hole you dig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside:&lt;/em&gt; in response to the plethora of responses everywhere online about people saying &quot;I compost meat and rarely see rats&quot;, I respond: &quot;Rats tend to come out when you're not there.  Trust me, they find the meat, unless your bin is under tight lockdown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asking a sustainability question about putting meat in a compost pile really is like asking one about the proper tire inflation pressure for a Humvee.  True, you can save some gas by keeping tires inflated properly, but if you have a Humvee at all, you've already gone awry.  I don't pose this comparison, simply as a rhetorical tactic.  The direct contribution of agriculture to global warming is roughly equivalent to that of transportation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/3213/Climate_change_and_agriculture.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;about 10-15%&lt;/a&gt;).  If you add in secondary effects from land-use change, it's even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding not to eat farmed meat at all is one of those currently uncomfortable sustainability solutions, along with having fewer babies, and not keeping pets.  People don't want to consider it, but the impact of the choice is large, and completely within your control, right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="486" LastEditorUserId="486" LastEditDate="2013-04-22T07:53:40.170" LastActivityDate="2013-04-22T07:53:40.170" CommentCount="11" />

The amount of oil from your chain is small even compared to the amount of oil that comes out of your exhaust, which in turn is small compared to the unburned hydrocarbons from the gasoline, which in tuern is small compared to what everyone in their SUV's are releasing.

There is s simlar product that uses teflon.  A friend who is an ardent cyclist claims that for these to work well, you have to remove ALL the oil from the chain.

Further, the plastic bottom of the kettle doesn't get extremely hot, so the bottom of the element must be insulated to keep most of the heat against the water. And since the bottom of the kettle is not vented, there's not much opportunity for convection to pull heat away from the heating element. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stove, on the other hand, relies on the weight of the pan to make contact with the element, and the spiral element may not be completely level, so some parts of the element are in better contact than others. Since the bottom of the element is exposed, it is free to radiate some of the heat down into the stove drip pan. Also, there seem to be some convection air currents carrying heat away, since if I hold my hand a few inches over the pan while heating water, it becomes uncomfortably warm in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I agree that there is some  heat lost in heating up both the kettle and the the pan, the specific heat of water is about 8 times greater than stainless steel, so the energy wasted in heating up the 24 ounce kettle is around the same energy needed to heat up 3 ounces of water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it all depends on what type of appliances you're using. I have a stove with traditional spiral elements, if I had an inductive cooktop, it's likely that it would be more efficient than the electric kettle since more of the stove's energy would be going into the cooking pan.

These include things like onions, cabbage, and other relatively long-keeping vegetables (onions don't need to be refridgerated, cabbage can last a long time in the fridge).  Buy many other things when you need them (like meat).  This gives you fresher food and better awareness of what is in the fridge.

Keep in mind if I am by myself I can go through cabbage between one head in a couple of days to one head in two weeks, so having two heads of cabbage in my fridge is usually a good thing since it keeps well.  Other things like tomatoes, other veggies, meat (when I don't have it in my freezer from local farm purchases), etc. I buy for the meal I want to cook.

Assuming this is no problem, my best bet would be that a mix of Eisenia Fetida and Eisenia Hortensis has the highest throughput rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long answer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most research on vermicomposting focuses on reproduction and grow rates of different worms species. It is assumed that higher reproduction rates means more juvenile worms which in turn means a higher processing rate. I'm not entirely sure if this assumption is true but since we have nothing else to go on I'll stick with reproduction and grow rates for my answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mixing worm species can be done just fine as long as you can keep the conditions in your bin suited for all species involved. Chances are however that the conditions will be more favorable for one particular type of worm and that this worm will flourish and the population of the other worms will decline, so not all combinations of worm species will result in an effective mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most research on vermicomposting worms favor Eisenia Fetida (a.k.a red worm) for a number of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fetida worms have fast reproduction and grow rates, &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;they tolerate and can survive under a wide range of circumstances, &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;they don't mind disturbances of their enviroment (at least not so much as other worm species like the Eudrilus Eugeniae). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that the Fetida worm has become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wormcomposting.ca/worms/red-worms-eisenia-fetida/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the most popular one&lt;/a&gt; for vermicomposting. A bin with only Fetida worms certainly is a good choice to get a good throughput rate under different circumstances. The only problem with Fetida worms is that they tend to stay close to the surface. They don't eat food that is buried deep into a bin. That's why I think you might be able to get a slightly higher throughput rate if you add Eisenia Hortensis (a.k.a. Dendobaena Veneta or European nightcrawler) worms. Hortensis worms like it a bit more wet and colder than Fetida worms, but both species will do ok in circumstances that are a bit less than ideal. Additionally, Hortensis worms like to spread out all over the bin so if you add food both at the top as well as deeper into the bin you'll get a larger surface of active worms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that there has been some discussion about Hortensis worms. Research done in the late 80s and early 90s showed that the Hortensis had a rather low reproduction and grow rate, but in the late 90s this has been questioned by a number of worm farmers. Several people have reported that they found that the Hortensis worm can grow and reproduce just as fast as the Fetida  and claim the different results can be explained by the difference in bin conditions or in the food supplied to the worms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://vermicomposters.ning.com/group/eiseniahortensisfarmers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redwormcomposting.com/worm-composting/european-nightcrawler-cocoons/#comment-3489&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://vermicomposters.ning.com/profiles/blogs/eisenia-hortensis-european&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). AFAIK the high reproduction rate of the Hortensis has not been proven scientifically yet but the fact is that the Hortensis worm has gained quite a bit of popularity in the last 10 years. If the Hortensis worm indeed has a similar reproduction and grow rate then it may outperform the Fetida worm when it comes to throughput rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I said in my quick answer, ultimately it will depend on the circumstances in your bin(s) and your abilities to keep those circumstances ideal for one or more types of worms. If you have a rather wet bin, it might be best just to use only Hortensis worms. If you have a lot of temperature changes the Fetida worm may be better. If your bin is kept at a constant temperature of around 25 Celsius (77 F) a bin with only Eudrilus Eugeniae might be the better choice. The best way to find out what works for you is simply to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just found this very interesting answer of Robert Moore at the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchgate.net/post/Producing_a_hybrid_species_of_composting_worms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What I have found is that combined breeding does increase the breadth of microbial species versus that found in single-species breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is mainly the saprophytic microbial activity that composts, not the earthworm per se.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The rate of decomposition is therefore a matter of the diversity and density of the microbial community along with how many earthworm mouths are present for a given volume of bedding which should be at C:N of 30:1 for maximum microbial reproduction within newly-prepared bedding, and harvested at 25:1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="99" LastEditorUserId="99" LastEditDate="2013-05-15T08:38:26.160" LastActivityDate="2013-05-15T08:38:26.160" />

If you run your dishwasher half full, that's going to be bad for energy and water use.  Similarly, if you hand wash, with the hot water running the whole time, that's bad.  So, either technique requires tuning the way you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, dishwashers have some inherent advantages, in that they're closed units.  Being closed units allows them to build up heat and humidity.  That helps the washing process.  It also means that water sprayed on dishes in the upper rack can then filter down, and rinse dishes in the lower rack.  The same goes for water that's sprayed horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, understand that a dishwasher is fundamentally different than a clotheswasher.  A dishwasher doesn't need to spend a lot of energy physically moving around heavy clothes and a large tankful of water.  Much of the energy a dishwasher uses is in heating the water.  But, that happens with handwashing, too.  Hopefully, you can intuitively see that if the issue is largely about heating water, it's easier to do so in an enclosed space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to reproduce a thorough analysis myself, I'll point to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/kitchen-design/built-in-dishwashers-vs-hand-washing-which-is-greener.html&quot;&gt;article on treehugger.com&lt;/a&gt;.  An important excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These numbers indicate that it's possible to be more efficient when&#xA;  hand-washing, but it's pretty tough. Can you successfully wash and&#xA;  rinse a soiled dinner plate in just over a cup of water? If you can&#xA;  keep the water use low, equal to an efficient machine, you'll require&#xA;  less energy, but doing an entire load of dishes in 4 gallons of water&#xA;  is roughly equivalent to doing them all in the same amount of water&#xA;  you use in 96 seconds of showering (using a showerhead that emits 2.5&#xA;  gallons per minute).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So, as long as you don't often run your dishwasher when it's only half&#xA;  full of dirty dishes, or unless you are very miserly with your water&#xA;  use (or have an old, inefficient dishwasher), the automatic dishwasher&#xA;  is likely to be more efficient. That is to say, it's possible to use&#xA;  less water and energy by hand washing your dishes, but it's not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll also address another point in the other answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When you automate things, you substitute electricity for manual energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Manual energy&quot; doesn't come from nowhere.   It comes from the food we eat.  Powering a human being involves converting sun, water, and soil into food, processing the food, then letting the human convert it into usable energy.  &lt;strong&gt;The human body, combined with the agricultural inputs&lt;/strong&gt;, do not represent an &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt; &quot;machine&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd also offer the somewhat &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; argument regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost&quot;&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/a&gt;.  The time you'd spend handwashing dishes might better be spent on something else.  If you're interested in sustainability (yeah!), then consider what other sustainable projects you could work on with the X hours a month you'd spend handwashing dishes.  Perhaps add some insulation to your attic?  Add mulch to your garden?  Brew biodiesel yourself?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these things matter in the overall assessment of what saves energy, or makes energy usage more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if I had to be tied down to a short, simple answer, I'd say that &lt;strong&gt;yes, a dishwasher does (tend to) save water&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="486" LastEditorUserId="486" LastEditDate="2013-05-02T12:52:10.007" LastActivityDate="2013-05-02T12:52:10.007" />

The light gets absorbed into objects and stays there. To keep the light buzzing through your room to make it feel bright, you need to make sure that as much in your room as possible reflects light. Mirrors reflect almost 100% of the light, i.e. more mirrors means less light absorption means a brighter room. Light colours (white) reflect more light than dark colours (brown/black). If you change your interior design, you will have a brighter room and may not need to add more light. (If you add mirrors to your room, it would be most efficient to place them where the light enters the room.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often, countries with long winters (e.g. Norway, see below) have bright interior designs, because in the winter period one has to keep as much light as possible from being absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Countries with mild winters and strong sun during the day (e.g. Spain, picture below) tend to have darker designs, presumably to allow the eyes to rest at least inside the house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://maxcdn.fooyoh.com/files/attach/images/627/587/592/vivendelstien-house-in-norway-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norwegian house&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://theluxhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Elegant-and-luxurious-office-interior-design-ideas-1-533x354.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spanish office&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="85" LastActivityDate="2013-05-02T14:51:58.950" />

In other words, I think it's clear that with &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; education, humans would still be stuck in primitive societies, which &lt;strong&gt;were&lt;/strong&gt; sustainable, and involved small per capita resource usage.  As education increases, you do get an increase in resource consumption, with a standard-of-living increase.  However, I believe that in the future, we can achieve lower levels of resource consumption again, with further &lt;strong&gt;increases&lt;/strong&gt; in education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;More time living alone means more energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Staying in school doesn't just mean &lt;em&gt;&quot;living alone&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.  It probably also means living modestly, in a small apartment.  And it often does mean living with roommates.  The people at both the universities I went to (in the US) all lived with small energy and spatial footprints, relative to working adults in the surrounding society.  So, I'd say this issue favors staying in school, as more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/if-you-act-your-age-whats-your-carbon-footprint/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A link on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; footprint vs. age that reflects this issue&lt;/a&gt;, although school vs. work at the same age is not teased apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Fewer children may have both positive and negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While, technically this is true (there are positive &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; negative effects), I strongly disagree with the implied equivalency.  Human beings consume lots of resources.  Lots.  In those countries where higher education is a realistic option (as posed in your question), humans consume even more resources.  More humans fundamentally means more resource consumption.  Not to mention the basic math that birth rates above the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikigender.org/index.php/Replacement_rate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;replacement rate&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; unsustainable, as long as we're bound to this one planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Less career time means less overall energy available for manual production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exactly.  As I alluded to earlier, students do have lower environmental footprints than an average working adult.  The amount of work output by today's current population vastly exceeds that required to fulfill basic human needs (as evidenced by many of us working in jobs that are not fundamentally &lt;strong&gt;necessary&lt;/strong&gt;).  We need people to be working at jobs &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; than they do now (in the developed world), and producing less.  I'm not advocating education simply on the grounds that it takes time away from production, but I do believe that's a beneficial side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;and the labor is automated via cheap energy sources like fossil fuels. This leads to less flexibility regarding reducing energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Labor will be automated regardless, and less educated workers could actually provide more incentive to automate.  I've seen a number of your posts on the site that suggest to me that you think &lt;em&gt;automation&lt;/em&gt; fundamentally increases energy usage.  While that could be its own separate discussion, I'll merely assert here that I find that to be false (and my apologies if that's not actually your belief).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Less time and flexibility to make informed choices regarding sustainability because of additional burdens like student loans requiring additional efforts to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, you &lt;strong&gt;can't&lt;/strong&gt; make informed choices without education.  Education underlies all decision-making.  If there's any obstacle to sustainability today in the US (where I live), it's &lt;strong&gt;ignorance&lt;/strong&gt; of the basic science that supports consensus thinking on climate change.  While there are educated skeptics who simply don't trust climate science, want more data, or believe the solution is elsewhere (not sustainability, but something like &lt;em&gt;geoengineering&lt;/em&gt;), the majority here are skeptical because of a lack of basic understanding of the science.  I believe a subject like this, while possible to treat at the high school level, is probably better expanded on at universities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, at least in the US, it's not true that taking out student loans requires working more to make ends meet.  It's precisely the opposite.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Higher levels of education reap higher lifetime earnings&lt;/a&gt; by an amount that easily pays for the cost of the extra education (plus interest).  Granted, that equation is going to be different in every country, as tuition rates vary, as do student loan interest rates.  But, based simply on the example of the world's largest developed economy, you do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; wind up having to work more simply because you paid for more education.  You may &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to work more, because you have a more enjoyable career, or have suffered less &lt;em&gt;wear-and-tear&lt;/em&gt; from a white collar career.

This transition, may surprise many companies waiting in the wings for signs of life in the global economy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, an increasingly global workforce may require a strategic approach to mobility and cross-border/cross-functional collaboration. This includes the provision of work arrangement options that engage employees across all demographics, with most employees expecting their employer to offer them more tools, flexibility, and choice. Further, multiple generations in the workplace are already causing friction as work styles shift from status quo to status carpe diem. As younger colleagues step up into management roles, they may likely make decisions that include the use of virtual work practices for their teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Usefulness and relevance varies. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/02/17/how-telecommuting-lets-workers-mobilize-sustainability?page=0%2C0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How Telecommuting Lets Workers Mobilize for Sustainability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;US Government fuel economy site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/consres.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Specific sustainability comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.att.com/gen/landing-pages?pid=22872&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T sustainability report with Telecommuting reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.ucsf.edu/1.196&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;USCF sustainability page with links to telecommuting guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ucsfhr.ucsf.edu/index.php/policies/article/telecommuting-guidelines-and-procedures1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;USCF telecommuting guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ucsfhr.ucsf.edu/index.php/policies/cat/site/Telecommuting/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://humanresources.syr.edu/worklife/fws_telecommuting.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Syracuse university sustainability &amp;amp; telecommuting page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://assembly.cornell.edu/Suggestions/2008FallSustainabilityTelecommuting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cornell - sadly bare page!!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.teleworkexchange.com/teleworker-09-10f.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;THE TELEWORKER - overview re sustainability &amp;amp; other sectors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omec.uab.cat/Documentos/TIC_desenvolupament/0132.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UN, global e-sustainability reprot {dated}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... some reasoned arguments about Telecommuting in sustainablity terms - how much of an energy costs in there to working at home compared with commuting X miles in Y minutes by Z mode of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by commenting on factors involved:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some jobs it just doesn't work, of course. For example, a commercial cleaner is never going to &quot;work from home&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have largely here just referred to &quot;cost&quot; rather than energy cost except in a few specific cases. While energy cost percentage of a given item or service varies with circumstance, in an open market where other factors have not been purposefully brought to bear (directed taxes and duties, marketing 'spin', cartels,...) , energy cost is a significant and &lt;em&gt;very roughly&lt;/em&gt; constant proportion of total cost.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;[eg Oil costs nothing when it is in the ground. The major part of its market cost is the cost of exploration, field development, extraction and transportation. These in turn can be broken down into components where energy cost ends up playing a major part. And ultimately you get back to the cost of oil as the main factor in the cost of oil :-).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The price of diamonds and the cost of diamonds are essentially unrelated.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The cost of Nike products includes a large &quot;Just do it&quot; factor.]  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting with just &quot;cost&quot; is often an OK enough proxy for energy costs while a first impression is gained of what other factors are involved. This can then be refined as required. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It depends on distance involved.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Take the two  extremes and you get different answers, indicating that there is a crossover point at some stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one extreme, if your home was  &quot;just around the corner&quot; from work premises then duplication of facilities would be liable to be inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other extreme, once work-location and company physical location are separated, you can communicate across a city or across the world just as easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as distance rises the cost and time for sending physical objects varies, so the importance and frequency of doing this affects the crossover point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various factors discussed below modify where this crossover point will be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much distance matters depends on job type and how well you can operate at a large distance. Distance can increase efficiency of telecommuting because of the cost savings of you not having to travel, and increase the cost on the occasions when you do have to travel. Within a city or regional area factors include type of job, traffic densities, distance between the locations, quality of transport infrastructure and more. It is reasonably common in Asia for people to travel for 2 or more hours per day in each direction, but many take far less than this. I do not know the expectations in say the US or Europe but trip times of half an hour to one hour + would be usual here (Auckland, New Zealand's largest city) and two hours would be unusual but not unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have to send papers or equipment or samples or work output then distance and time taken rise in 'steps'. Sending materiel across a city takes hours to a day by courier. Sending by post often next day or two days. Shorter times cost more as distance rises (&quot;1 hour&quot; couriers etc). In most 'developed countries' across a country sending by courier takes maybe a day or two, possibly three (depends on local factors). Sending small items (up to 10 or 20 kg say*) or papers across the world takes 3 days if you are happy to pay between an hour and a day of equivalent salary (depending on what your local earning levels are) or weeks to many weeks at lower but non-trivial cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your job depends only on &quot;communications&quot; and you seldom or never need to send physical objects then it's more efficient to tele-commute in extreme cases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To complicate the mix throw in worker trustability, ability to supervise and ability to obtain assistance or guidance when needed. Ability tos share with others you are working with or for can be critically important or of minimal relevance depending on the job involved. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So  while, as noted above , somewhere there will be a &quot;crossover point&quot; it is so influenced by the above factors and many more that a simple (or even quite complex) formula is only going to be a starting point, and a study is likely to be required in each case where factors differ markedly from others already in operation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two extreme examples:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In a recent TV program here the owner managers of a UK based company, who live in New Zealand (12,000 miles and about two days away) were discussing their customer helpline operation. The job requires &quot;only&quot; a 'telephone' connection and computer access.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Up until 7:59 pm each day, UK time,  this is operated by UK company staff. At 8pm you will be answered by a company employee in New Zealand. The calls are not outsourced. The people who talk to customers are product experts and company employees. They have access to the same company computer databases and resources. Interestingly, while they are 12,000 miles away from the customers, in this instance they still work in an office in NZ, and not at their homes. On the one hand the company has its NZ employees &quot;tele-commute&quot; 12,000 miles, but have not taken the final step of allowing them to take the final step, even though technology would allow it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am close to but not quite at the extreme end. I sit at my desk or workshop in New Zealand. As required I work almost simultaneously at various places elsewhere on earth - at present in USA, Canada, Serbia and China as required. Nobody that I work for or with is in NZ with me. Commuting is fun enough, when I occasionally get to do it, but there is no daily &quot;travelling to work&quot;. When you take the energy costs of travel plus a proportion of accommodation &amp;amp; other costs involved (to allow for their energy costs) it adds up to what would be a modest but significant transportation budget if I travelled within my own city. But the annual travel hours are significantly lower, even allowing for the duration of international travel. Occasionally samples and prototypes do have to be sent across the world (usually NZ-China) costing time and money. But, quite apart from the fact that it would be impossible to be in all the places I need to be if I did not work &quot;remotely&quot;, the cost of 'working from home' is lower than it would be for me to work on the far side of my own city. I think it probable that by any metric that you choose, it is lower cost for me to &quot;telecommute&quot; than not to. I have not discussed the  cost of work premises or equipment or the affects of tax concessions for 'home offices' etc as they further complicate what is essentially a very broad overview. . &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many major international courier companies offer &quot;Jumbo&quot; boxes with 10 kg or 20 kg maximum weight and &quot;all you can fit in&quot; volume constraint. These are often superbly cost effective if you need to send more than about 50% of their weight in the volume provided. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="318" LastEditorUserId="318" LastEditDate="2013-05-08T03:51:02.517" LastActivityDate="2013-05-08T03:51:02.517" CommentCount="2" />

If no other factors apply and sustainability is the only meaning of life, no children, collective suicide and controlled extinction of human race seems to be the best solution. This is clearly not what we really want (not only because nuclear warfare and other ways we would probably do to assure controlled extinction are much less sustainable than status quo). &gt;=)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's other definition of sustainability: sustainable society can exist for very long time (even for the rest of humankind's existence) without destroying its environment and running out of all its resources (some may run out if they are completely replaced by other - but it takes time, so they mustn't be depleted very quickly). This is easier with less people, but discipline is much more important than numbers. Many people really trying to live sustainably produce less waste than few who don't care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the social aspect: slightly more than two children are ideal to sustain the society forever. Assuming most children will grow up and have their families (which is often not the case), much more children will lead to overpopulation, while less children will lead to aging of the population, high percentage of old and frail and decreased stability of the society. This doesn't mean that every family should have exactly 2.1 kid, but that it's good to move the average closer to this value. In most rich countries, we have a dilemma between having no/few children and improve the average planetwise (and make the country's society demographically less sustainable), or having many children and improve the average countrywise (but adding to global overpopulation). So it's up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we can argue a lot whether it's better to have many or few children, we would certainly all agree that it's important how you raise your kids. Few families can really teach their children to resist the ads and other influences forcing them to buy a lot of things and not to care about sustainability very much. My personal opinion is that ten children with sustainable habits and strong belief that loving family or nice countryside are more important than things and money are much more sustainable than one kid who think that hapiness is a function of money spent on products advertised on TV.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To conclude, I'd say that the best is as much children as you can raise well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58" LastActivityDate="2013-05-06T13:23:38.680" />

Now I assume this is no problem in your case, since you speak of waste &quot;heat&quot;, hinting that the rest of the environment is &lt;em&gt;colder&lt;/em&gt;, so you have a difference. Nevertheless, it is something to consider during construction of any such device. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of waste water: the most obvious solution would be to let cold water flow through the (hot) waste water, thus allow the cold water to heat up. The cold water (now warmer) is then used as new clean hot water in the appliance. In the case of showers (or comparable), this would mean you'd have to add less hot water from the boiler, thus saving energy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For other applications, you could use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_generator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thermoelectric generators&lt;/a&gt; (or more general, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which will convert heat directly into electricity. You can buy such things pretty much everywhere; they're pretty cheap and come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, allowing you to effectively utilize many sources of waste heat as power source. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are however not very efficient. A much more efficient approach seems to be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stirling engine&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, it's not as elegant as thermoelectric generators: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it has moving parts, therefore, it sustains losses due to friction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;has steeper maintenance requirements&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it's more complicated so has a steeper learning curve to build yourself&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it needs to be attached to a generator since it doesn't generate electricity itself&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is so much more efficient that if ever I have the time and money, I'd put my money on these things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also interesting: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_tube&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vortex tube&lt;/a&gt;. This thing allows you to split a stream of gas into hot and cold components, with 100% efficiency (provided you have a pressurized waste product :). A version for fluids exists as well, which, when used with waste water, would allow you to increase the temperature difference. But again, I haven't calculated anything; I'm not sure whether this would increase the total power output by the Stirling engine + turbine contraption.

Understand your demand profile.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First you need to know the profile of your electricity use.  Ideally hour-by-hour for a whole year; but at least an understanding of what's likely to be the two underlying cycles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;annual variations - how the load varies by month in a typical year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;daily variations - how the load varies by hour in a typical day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective things you can do, is to max out the efficiency of the equipment you want to power: so LED lighting that's over 100 lumens per watt, that sort of thing. That minimises both the generation capacity, and any storage capacity, you might need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;2. Understand the potential supply profile&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2a. Solar&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nature of the solar resource, for photovoltaics, will be influenced by local shading patterns: the exact geometric configuration of buildings; and by the climate of the region you are in. If you can find a big-enough surface area that you can mount PV panels that would slope towards the equator, and almost never be shaded, that removes the local shading from the calculation, and that makes thing a lot simpler.  To get typical PV yield for your region, and to find out the best slope, then use a tool such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/&quot;&gt;PVGIS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrel.gov/rredc/pvwatts/&quot;&gt;PVWatts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2b. wind&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wind profile is much much more susceptible to local geometry than solar is.  But you should be able to get a decent broadbrush indication from your national meteorological service, or one of the various global wind-resource maps, to get a first estimate.  You can pretty much ignore most roof-mounted turbines: they've such a low yield that many won't generate equivalent energy to that used to make them. Pole-mounted turbines are a better bet, but if you're in an urban area, then it's fairly unlikely that wind will be a contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;3. Understand correlations between supply and demand&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some demands are positively correlated with wind or solar; some are negatively correlated. It's important to understand those correlations, otherwise you risk generating power at all the wrong times, and not at the right times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, lighting may be predominantly a night-time demand, so it would be strongly negatively correlated with solar, and that's a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To take some counter examples: solar for air-conditioning would be a good match, because air-conditioning demand is higher when it's very sunny. Wind in the UK is higher in winter than summer, so a demand that is higher in winter than summer would be a positive correlation and a good match: for example, heating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;4. Storage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, when many people think about renewables, they usually assume local storage is essential. And in most circumstances, they're wrong. The exception is when the site in question is not grid-connected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In such a case, then you'll have two choices: storage, or load disconnection. Storage is usually expensive, so make sure that you know the value of load disconnection, to price the storage correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a trade-off between the amount of storage you need, and the over-supply of generation capacity that you get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastActivityDate="2013-05-06T17:35:04.180" />

I would like to create a graph, plotting total energy consumption versus time (so money is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; considered), with four lines in them (one for each of the aforementioned types), that takes into account: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The energy it takes to create a single bulb&lt;/strong&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/883/how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-create-a-single-light-bulb&quot;&gt;this related question&lt;/a&gt;. For example, to create a tungsten-filament light bulb, you need tungsten, glass, some metals, some plastics, a mixture of specific gases, cardboard and plastics for the packaging, ... Extraction/production/transportation of these materials takes an amount of energy per kg. Shaping it into a filament/glass housing/metal fitting/etc. takes an amount of energy, etc. In other words, from the &quot;stuff that's in the ground&quot; to &quot;finished product in the store&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replacement time&lt;/strong&gt; (this is why LED's will probably have a smooth line, and tungsten-filament bulbs-line will probably show frequent upward jumps due to replacement). The nominal amount of burn hours stated on the packages (mean time before failure, MTBF) is not really sufficient here; these are averages somehow, and frequently come from calculations or laboratory setups rather than actual real-life usage (how else can they claim that LED's can be lit for 10 years continuously?). Also, there is a finite chance that the average user will accidentally drop the bulb, crash into it with a ladder, etc, which is far worse for tungsten-filament bulbs and luminescent tubes than for LED's in protective casings. So, a far more realistic statistical model should be assumed here, which I can't find any reliable, authorative sources for...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy expenditure due to &lt;strong&gt;disposal&lt;/strong&gt; and/or &lt;strong&gt;recycling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation&lt;/strong&gt;.

When the growth is constant and negative, the population will decay until there is no one left in the far future. So both a population growth and decay are not sustainable since both cannot continue indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So a first order approach would be to strive for a growth factor such that each generation has as many people as the previous. If you translate that requirement to a single person, that means that everybody must get one exactly child. Since it takes two people to create a new one, as a couple you will be sustainable if you have two children, in which you both have half a share. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This of course neglects the fact that some people die before they have children, so if you want to compensate for that you may choose to have 2.05 children of course. However that still rounds to 2. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question would then be what is a sustainable population?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And is that a constant number or does it change due to better use of natural resources?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the world is currently overpopulated. And whether that is in fact true or not doesn't really matter in my opinion. Why should we strive to have as much people as we can feed on this planet? I don't think it makes a better living if we are with 9 billion instead of 6 billion. Actually the quality of life seems to suffer from having the maximum number of people. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to increase the quality of life, you need to have a slight decline in population. You don't want to decline too fast, since that has severe social and economic consequences. Who will look after you when you are old? Who will invest in new buildings if there is no one to buy them in the future? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think 2 children is a nice figure to aim for.

Most of the complications come from your interpretation of &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;.  Let me give you a quick summary and explain why it isn't enough:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiberglass&lt;/strong&gt; insulation is the most common these days.  It is easy to install.  However, it is not healthy to breath, so the installer must wear protection to avoid contact with skin and inhalation.  It has higher embodied energy than cellulose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victoria.ac.nz/cbpr/documents/pdfs/ee-coefficients.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;(970 MJ/m^3)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blown Cellulose (dry)&lt;/strong&gt; insulation is not as common these days since it settles.  This causes the top of the wall over time to become not insulated at all.  For a diligent home owner, and depending on how the wall was constructed, this can be fixed by periodically adding insulation from the top of the wall.  However, this problem is harder to deal with when there is compaction under windows and other places where it is hard to access later.  It has lower embodied energy than fiberglass &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victoria.ac.nz/cbpr/documents/pdfs/ee-coefficients.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;(112 MJ/m^3)&lt;/a&gt;.  This can easily be used in attics where settling isn't much of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet Cellulose (wet)&lt;/strong&gt; insulation is very similar to blown cellulose except that it is blown in wet so that it binds to whatever it hits and doesn't settle over time.  This is fairly standard, but can only be around 4&quot; thick before you have to start embedding some plastic or other support to help hold up the insulation.  It is string enough to not sag, but not when spanning large gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Styrofoam&lt;/strong&gt; insulation is often used under foundations, but also in walls.  It is strong and easy to install, but the manufacture still creates many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.earthresource.org/campaigns/capp/capp-styrofoam.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;harmful chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, to both those manufacturing it and the general air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice Hulls&lt;/strong&gt; can be used in a similar was as blown cellulose and has similar problems.  It can settle, though I haven't been able to find anyone saying how much they settle.  It is also an agricultural waste product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spray Foam&lt;/strong&gt; is often used to fill in lots of gaps and is great for sealing your walls.  A lot of heat is lost through tiny cracks in walls, around windows, etc.  Spray foam in these places can be especially helpful.  There are many spray foams available, some claiming to be 'green,' which one is most sustainable could be its own question.  Most spray foam is toxic enough that there are warnings on the label saying you shouldn't let it touch your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sawdust&lt;/strong&gt; was used a long time ago, but has since been replaced by blown cellulose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade Offs&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Do you consider small amounts of ozone 'unsustainable?'  What are the trade-offs between ozone depletion and embodied energy (styrofoam vs fiberglass)?  What are local labor costs?  If one insulation takes twice as long to install, perhaps you'd have been better off installing the easy/cheap one, and putting the rest of the money in solar panels, organic food or any number of other places.  Extra thick walls to support extra insulation will (depending on your wall construction method) require extra wall material (wider studs in a framed wall).  That could also be factored in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermal Mass&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Another thing to consider is thermal mass.  It is helpful to have things like concrete, earth, brick and water inside (or a part of your inside wall).  This is most helpful in places which have large temperature swings.  In these places if it is 70 during the day and 20 at night, your thermal mass can hold your house at daytime temperatures all night, without having to turn on the heat (and visa-versa in the summer with cool nights).  In places where the swings are less, thermal mass is less important, though still helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Tight&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Even if you have highly insulated walls, small gaps which let outside air inside and visa-versa can have a huge impact on heating/cooling bills.

You can just pick your favorite insulation and make sure the walls are designed to use it effectively. From a heating standpoint, it doesn't really matter if you use fiberglass, foam, insulated concrete forms, or blown-in cellulose as long as the wall assemblies have the R-value your looking for and everything is built and installed correctly. In a cold climate, reducing heating fuel consumption will have a far greater impact over the useful life of the insulation than choosing &quot;green&quot; materials. That said, some materials are clearly more sustainable than others. Refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/897/462&quot;&gt;Zach's answer&lt;/a&gt; for more information on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're buying an existing but under-insulated home you might want blown-in cellulose because it can be installed in uninsulated cavities without tearing apart the wall. It's also very simple to add a layer in the attic. If/when you need to replace the siding, you might want to install foam boards between the wall and the new siding. Foam boards are also a good option for masonry or concrete walls. Wood-framed structures will probably give you more options for adding insulation than masonry or concrete walls will because wood-framed walls have cavities that can be filled with just about any type of insulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that insulation only prevents heat transfer through itself. Studs between insulated cavities will conduct heat better than you'd like no matter what. Ideally, your home will have a continuous &quot;shell&quot; of insulation that is broken only by windows, doors, plumbing penetrations, and exhaust outlets/air intakes. That said, some insulation is better than none, and at some point the cost just isn't worth it unless you have a whole lot of money to throw around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="462" LastEditorUserId="462" LastEditDate="2013-07-08T14:29:51.387" LastActivityDate="2013-07-08T14:29:51.387" CommentCount="3" />

The only really natural boundaries are those of the planet and those aren't very useful ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when we talk about lifecycle analysis or any of the rest of this, we are talking about what are fundamentally simplified models based on unprovable assumptions only some of which we may be aware of (something drilled into my head when studying computational environmental modelling in college).

For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LCA&lt;/a&gt;s provides a good measure of many (environment-related) sustainability aspects but are only available for 'simple' products like glass bottles, diapers and clothing, not for more complex products. Also LCAs are geographically dependent so that's also something to take into account. A second question is how do you derive the exact score of a product? For example, what will be the overall rating of a product with a good score on ecological footprint but very low on socio-economics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliable methods to gather the necessary information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding on a rating system is one thing, using it is another. The difficulty here is from where do you get the information you want and how do you get it? There are many companies that do not disclose information about how a product is made exactly, which raw materials are being used in their products or where they buy the materials. You'll probably want companies to cooperate and provide this information, but what about products from companies that don't cooperate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who will reliably assess and rate the products in a uniform manner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To rate all products all over the world you will need lots of people doing this. Perhaps some sort of co-creation / &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wisdom-of-the-crowds&lt;/a&gt; scheme is the way to go here, but you'll have to be careful for manipulation because if the label is succesful and widely recognised the stakes may be high for certain manufacturers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A way to inform the public about the rating given to products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can try and get a product's rating displayed on the product itself, but manufacturers that make products with low ratings will most likely not cooperate. Alternatively you can try to convince third-party sellers (e.g. supermarkets, shops) to disclose this information and display it on their shelves. Of course you can always put the information online but this is probably less effective as you won't reach spontaneous shoppers and people without internet access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support from the public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without public support, your chances of convincing companies, organisations and/or governments to cooperate and getting it certified will most likely fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously you need capital to somehow get all of this started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to getting the label certified globally, I don't really know how you should approach that. Different countries/governments/organisations have different goals and ideas, so I suspect many won't be interested or won't agree with the way you rate products. Also a well-recognized and globally-accepted label won't be in the interest of many manufacturers so it's likely that several companies will start a big lobbying campaign against the label if it becomes succesful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final note, rather than starting a global multi-aspect rating label from scratch, I think it would be much easier to try and cooperate with existing labels and see if you can combine the most reliable and useful labels and use them to derive your own rating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="99" LastActivityDate="2013-05-13T12:32:59.557" CommentCount="3" />

If the product gets a good mark, the manufacturer may decide to stick a label on their products.

(As long as you can convince him, that you are a label the consumer cares about, that is.) This alone requires a great marketing campaign, preferably with TV spots that explain even to the layman, why your label is something worth paying attention to. Anything more ambitious (like the organic labels) require support from the government and, presumably, a very serious source of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a small scale, I think you can already work wonders with marketing products, which you know to be good, never mind whether they have some &quot;organic&quot;, &quot;sustainably produced&quot;, &quot;whatever&quot; label. Telling the customers about the company and the production process is becoming more and more fashionable, but there is an inherent appeal to sustainably produced products.

The maturation time of an aspen poplar forest is around 60 years in our climate.  That gives me a 1.6 ton/year gross production over the life cycle of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So by one measure, I could extract something like 1 ton of biomass from the forest per acre per year, and do this indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that could be considered sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But wait:  I take that wood away, and burn it or make chip board or fence posts (bad idea, rots to fast) and with the celluose I'm taking small quantities of Phosphorus and potassium.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed:  places where they have done intensive forestry, after about 3 generations of trees being removed, they have problems with mineral deficiencies.

And those are impurities that don't completely ruin the material for recycling the way food does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As alluded to above, recycling companies make a profit by turning waste items into raw materials for manufacturing. So as long as what they receive isn't too badly contaminated, they do recycle it.

It's not an apples-to-apples comparison.  The claim is that one &lt;strong&gt;reusable&lt;/strong&gt; steel bottle is better than continually buying many &lt;em&gt;disposable&lt;/em&gt; plastic bottles.  Certainly, one steel bottle has a much bigger impact than one plastic bottle, but if you buy a nice $10 stainless steel water bottle, hopefully it'll get used over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you might suspect, this depends on many factors.  You can probably find many analyses online, but all of them will have to make some assumption about the rate at which bottles are recycled.  That may not be relevant to your decision.  &lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt; probably know how likely &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are to recycle plastic bottles, which might be much more than the average person.  For that average person, giving them a shiny possession (the steel bottle) might help discourage them from throwing away a seemingly &lt;em&gt;cheap&lt;/em&gt; plastic bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reasonable write-up of this issue was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/04/19/opinion/20090419bottle.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;one I found on the NY Times site&lt;/a&gt;.  Their conclusion was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What it comes down to is this: if your stainless steel bottle takes&#xA;  the place of 50 plastic bottles, the climate is better off, and if it&#xA;  gets used 500 times, it beats plastic in all the environment-impact&#xA;  categories studied in a life cycle assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can you reuse a steel bottle 50 times (the climate change balance point)?  Or do you lose bottles/lids too easily (or do like me and drive off with them on top of your car)?  And, again, do you religiously recycle plastic bottles, or only do so if a recycle bin is convenient?  Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/923/486&quot;&gt;I'm going to plug another question I asked here&lt;/a&gt;, as I think it's relevant, if you recycle via public bins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, try to remember that in general, with sustainability, you want to try to &lt;strong&gt;reduce&lt;/strong&gt; consumption first, if you can't do that, &lt;strong&gt;reuse&lt;/strong&gt; resources second, and only if that's not practical, &lt;strong&gt;recycle&lt;/strong&gt; last.

Most of that is thrown away because the &lt;em&gt;expiry date&lt;/em&gt; is reached, someone has cooked too much or, most trivially, is bored with some food and doesn't want to finish it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My tips and recommendations are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Never buy too much. Learn how much you are able to eat and how much do you need to buy. Don't improvise in shop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Don't throw food away just because expiry date is reached. Note that the expiry date is made only to remove liability from producers and it's calculated for the most pessimistic scenario of keeping the product (too high temperature, exposition to light etc.). I've eaten a lot of products months, and in some cases (products in cans or jars) even years after the expiry date, and I never had problems because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Be disciplined. If you prepare something, eat it to the end. If you can't eat more, wait an hour. If you still can't eat more, store it in fridge. Never throw something away even if the potato cooked the previous day doesn't taste as good as one cooked right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) In case of products that spoil very quickly in kitchen, such as fruits and vegetables, buy them regularly and in small portions that you can eat within 1 - (max) 3 days. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) Dry bread can be powdered and used for chops or some other meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6) Sweet fruits that are rotten but not moldy can be used to prepare a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hooch&lt;/a&gt;.

However, unless you have the resources to build to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house#Space_heating&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;passivhaus&lt;/a&gt; standards, these won't be your primary heat sources in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Geothermal heat systems (not to be confused with ground source heat pumps) also take advantage of naturally-available heat, but they are only possible near certain geologic features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that, the next most sustainable options are probably in-floor systems using solar-heated water and heat pumps (air-source and ground-source are the most common varieties). Solar water heat generally requires a back-up heat source in cloudy climates and at extreme latitudes, but it might be a good option for cold but sunny regions. Such systems typically require electric pumps to circulate the water through tubing in the floor. Heat pumps also run on electricity, so you can power them using clean sources, but even if you are using grid power from a coal-fired plant, heat pumps are more fuel-efficient than electric resistance heating or even many combustion furnaces[1]. While high-efficiency furnaces compete well with heat pumps for fuel efficiency, they can't take advantage of clean energy sources like the sun or wind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] Clarification: If 25% of the energy from the fuel makes it to your home as electricity, a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of just 2.5 will be more fuel efficient than a 70% efficient furnace in perfect condition. A COP of 3 will compete with or beat an 80% efficient furnace with a duct system for fuel efficiency. This doesn't account for differences in fuel (coal vs. fuel oil or natural gas), but it also assumes that the furnace is operating at its rated efficiency which is often not true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="462" LastEditorUserId="462" LastEditDate="2013-06-05T14:39:47.417" LastActivityDate="2013-06-05T14:39:47.417" CommentCount="3" />

Any such calculation is going to have to make quite a few assumptions.  Some assumptions may lead to slightly skewed results in individual cases, but averaged over all cases, they do a reasonable job.  In general, it's still a better way to estimate your impact than it would be to simply rely on &lt;strong&gt;intuition&lt;/strong&gt;, which sadly is what most people (even the eco-sensitive among us) do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also think it's important not to make the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; the enemy of the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.  We in the developed world probably need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch13s13-3-3-3.html&quot;&gt;reduce our carbon footprints by about 80%&lt;/a&gt; (or 90% in places like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/graph-showing-each-countrys.html&quot;&gt;US, Canada and Australia&lt;/a&gt;), so it's better to start cutting now, where you can, than to wait for the perfect data to guide you.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Online Calculators&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/climate-weather/stories/the-15-best-carbon-calculators&quot;&gt;list of some online carbon footprint calculators&lt;/a&gt; (US-biased, I should note).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the US Environmental Protection Agency's calculator, they actually let you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/GHGCalculator.xls&quot;&gt;download the spreadsheet containing their math, directly&lt;/a&gt;.  You can use that to hone in on your family's problem areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.org/greenliving/carboncalculator/&quot;&gt;This nature.org calculator&lt;/a&gt; does actually produce a pie chart at the end of your input, showing relative contributions to your carbon footprint:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/M6NWB.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Typical Scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think using a &lt;strong&gt;combination&lt;/strong&gt; of online carbon footprint calculators is the best bet to get a pretty good feeling for where you contribute the most to global warming.  But, for many people, these tend to be problem areas (with links for further reading):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food&lt;/strong&gt; - what type of diet do you have?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/EI167.1&quot;&gt;Meat, then poultry and fish,&lt;/a&gt; and then fruits and veggies tend to have the biggest impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (not just carbon, but methane from agriculture is a big problem, especially in the &quot;short&quot; term of the next 100 years).  Note: &lt;em&gt;locality&lt;/em&gt; tends to be an overrated aspect of your food's impact, as transportation to market is a fairly small part of the energy required to produce food (it does matter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psufoodscience.typepad.com/psu_food_science/files/es702969f.pdf&quot;&gt;but not as much as choice of food types&lt;/a&gt;).  Do you waste food (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/suistainability/pdf/Global_Food_Losses_and_Food_Waste.pdf&quot;&gt;1/3 or more of food globally is wasted&lt;/a&gt;), or eat more than your body really needs (pleasure eating)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heating&lt;/strong&gt; - how do you heat (or cool) your home?  Homes like apartments or condos are fundamentally easier than houses to keep at a constant temperature, both because they tend to be smaller, and because each unit doesn't have 5 sides that are exposed to the outside air.  Are you using a relatively efficient technology like a heat pump, or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/electric-resistance-heating&quot;&gt;less efficient one like electric baseboard heating&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/882/486&quot;&gt;Is your home well-insulated?&lt;/a&gt;  Do you keep your home warm in the winter, rather than turning down the thermostat and adding more clothing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Transport&lt;/strong&gt; - do you drive, or take the bus/walk?  If you drive, do you drive electric (most efficient, and best for GHG if you use renewable electricity), use biodiesel (not as thermodynamically &lt;em&gt;efficient&lt;/em&gt;, but most of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released was already in the air), drive a hybrid, a petro-diesel or gasoline car?  &lt;em&gt;For the most part&lt;/em&gt;, that's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php&quot;&gt;order of least to most impact on global warming&lt;/a&gt; (with each general technology having a range depending on many factors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroghg.com/flight_carbon_calculators.html&quot;&gt;airline travel&lt;/a&gt; is horrible for climate change.  Not only does it consume massive quantities of fossil fuels in a short period of time, but it's going to be much more difficult to &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; commercial aviation than it is to &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; automobiles, because power-to-weight ratio is so critical in airplanes.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.befrugal.com/tools/fly-or-drive-calculator/&quot;&gt;There isn't a huge difference in impact between flying and driving to the same remote destination&lt;/a&gt;, but the choice really is whether to take those long trips at all.  If you fly, especially across oceans (e.g. regularly for business or vacations), your &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt; carbon footprint will be large, no matter what else you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Consumption&lt;/strong&gt; - do you buy a lot of &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;?  Toys for kids.  New tools for your home or garden.  New appliances with more features.  Big TVs.  New clothes when old ones are out of style.  Everything we buy takes energy to make.  When we throw it away (or even recycle it), it causes more energy to be used, and greenhouse gases to be produced (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html&quot;&gt;trash decomposing in landfills&lt;/a&gt;).  Getting into the mindset of buying only what you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;, not just what you want, and keeping things you buy for a long time (or fixing them when they break), can reduce your impact substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproduction&lt;/strong&gt; - this isn't going to make people happy, as it's a taboo subject, but the number of children you have has a huge impact on climate change.  It's important not to get lured into the trap of considering only &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt; carbon footprints, because the environment knows nothing about the number of people ... only the total amount of greenhouse gas we produce.  More people mean more emissions, and at 7 billion and counting, it's simply no longer a reasonable argument to contend that we need to produce 2+ children per couple to sustain the human race.  Parents also frequently fall into the trap of thinking that because they live an eco-friendly lifestyle, their children will, too, when grown.  Kids are influenced by their parents, but also by the society they live in.  Right now, their society is a profoundly negative influence in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pets&lt;/strong&gt; - while this is another issue that upsets people, choosing to keep pets is a significant part of many families' impacts.  It certainly depends on the animal, its size, and activity level.  But, a large dog can easily add as much greenhouse gas in a year (mostly due to the fact that it probably consumes a meat-intensive, high-calorie diet) &lt;a href=&quot;http://phys.org/news176582720.html&quot;&gt;as an SUV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Electricity&lt;/strong&gt; (non-HVAC) - I'm going to gloss over this one, both because it's comprised of many small contributors and because I think many who read this will already have taken &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; steps, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/343/486&quot;&gt;using energy-efficient lighting&lt;/a&gt;.

But cardboard is probably more useful as a source of recycled fibers than as a construction material. Building a house out of cardboard would effectively take all of that cardboard out of the recycling loop in order to displace other materials such as wood and straw that can be produced sustainably but are not as easy to recycle. So I think in most cases it isn't a good sustainable building material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to build with the cardboard, for example if it isn't possible to recycle it in your area but you'd like to put it to good use, you'll need to protect it from fire and moisture. You'll probably need to use chemicals for fire protection, but the moisture issue probably just requires some attention to detail when installing vapor and moisture barriers during construction. If the cardboard gets wet, it will weaken and deteriorate, so water protection is very important. It will be nearly impossible to dry the interior of a &quot;solid&quot; cardboard wall if it gets wet. For practical questions about fireproofing and moisture protection, I recommend paying DIY Stack Exchange a quick visit. As far as cardboard's ability to support the weight of a house, I don't think there will be a problem--cardboard is an impressively sturdy material--but it might compress a little bit over time. A &lt;em&gt;carefully built&lt;/em&gt; cardboard house could be durable and efficient, but you will probably need to get help from construction experts to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cardboard house is possible, but without clever engineering, it's probably not worth building. I strongly encourage you to engage in clever engineering. A durable, efficient cardboard house that beats wood, masonry, concrete, and straw bale in cost, efficient use of materials, and performance would be a truly wonderful invention. But I don't think a straw bale-style cardboard house will do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="462" LastActivityDate="2013-06-06T16:59:05.610" />

LED lighting may be great from an energy consumption standpoint, and not as good with respect to finite material usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Energy Use vs Material Supply&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's important, however, to apply some &lt;em&gt;weighting&lt;/em&gt; to the different factors.  I don't believe we're &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt; at a critical point with respect to rare earth material supply, but I believe we are already at a critical point with respect to climate change (primarily, that we have already passed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://350.org/en/understanding-350&quot;&gt;350 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt; threshold that many climate scientists believe is necessary to preserve the climate that humans have flourished in).  So, in my opinion, it would be poor strategy to pass up energy-saving technologies in favor of technologies that save raw materials that we aren't running out of yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Light bulbs are unique devices, because they're small, but use lots of energy over their lifetimes.  Their relative material footprint isn't that big, compared to their energy footprint.  LED lights are expensive to produce, and use much more scarce material than incandescent bulbs, but they last for years (or decades).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LED lights are already the most energy efficient lighting solution available for most residential applications, and there is good reason to think &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/887/486&quot;&gt;they'll soon pass compact fluorescents by a significant margin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Short Term Supply Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/rare-earth-elements/downloads/GE_RareEarthPaper_7.20.11.pdf&quot;&gt;Here is a report on GE's website about rare earth supply constraints&lt;/a&gt;.  It's important to note, however, that current price spikes in these materials are largely an &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon.  95% of these materials are currently supplied by China, because China's policy is heavily influenced by &lt;strong&gt;engineers&lt;/strong&gt; who saw this trend coming.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ledsmagazine.com/features/8/2/7&quot;&gt;China is also imposing export quotas&lt;/a&gt;. There are significant rare earth material reserves in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20021139-54/pay-dirt-why-rare-earth-metals-matter-to-tech-faq/&quot;&gt;US (e.g. Nevada) and Australia&lt;/a&gt;, but the higher cost of labor here/there hasn't yet convinced those countries' companies or governments to ramp up production.  It also takes years to bring new mines online.  So, I would expect in the future, as climate problems worsen, and China's economy surpasses that of the US, this &lt;strong&gt;supply&lt;/strong&gt; limitation will ease.  Whether it will ease enough to satisfy increased &lt;strong&gt;demand&lt;/strong&gt; requires a crystal ball (also a rare earth material).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Recycling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue sometimes brought up is &lt;em&gt;recylability&lt;/em&gt;.  It's important not to assume that because a material isn't currently recycled, it's not recyclable.  This assumption is &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/612/486&quot;&gt;made repeatedly with electric car batteries&lt;/a&gt;.  Until products like LED lights are getting disposed of in large numbers, economic factors limit the opportunities for recycling them.  That's not a long-term problem though, if LED lights (and other rare earth applications) catch on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Long Term&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the theoretical potential for renewable energy is enormous.  Just between solar and wind power, there is thousands of times more energy hitting the earth than we need (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10933.full?sid=0de8da4b-cff2-461f-a2de-e31dced9bda5&quot;&gt;and even the &lt;em&gt;harvestable&lt;/em&gt; potential is much more than we need&lt;/a&gt;).  We're just not harvesting much of it now, in favor of consuming ten million year old sunlight stored in fossil fuels.  But, in the long term future, we may be able to (once again) use technologies that use more energy, if the energy is &lt;em&gt;renewable&lt;/em&gt;.  At that point, we may decide to reduce, or reinvent LED lighting.

It is a composite material, in which the hemp fibers are mixed&#xA;  with other materials to form a strong bond. Hemp has been known to&#xA;  have a low U-value, that is, it allows a lower heat levels to pass&#xA;  through it. The lower the U-value, the better the insulator a material&#xA;  is. It has been proven that Hemp insulation has a U-value of .040,&#xA;  which compares favorably to the U-value rate of 8-inches of insulation&#xA;  of fiberglass…Hemp's R-value stands at about R-3.5 per inch of&#xA;  thickness. The more the material limits the flow of heat through it,&#xA;  the higher its R-value…Insulation made from hemp is a natural buffer.&#xA;  It helps regulate condensation levels without causing any&#xA;  deterioration to thermal efficiency. This eliminates mold which is a&#xA;  major challenge to timber frames. Timber has been known to rot and get&#xA;  distorted in shape when exposed to high moisture levels especially&#xA;  during storage…Hemp also allow buildings to “breathe”.

No.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does it &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; to face the equator?  Yes, but probably not as much as most people might think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Elaboration&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solar panels are surprisingly productive, even if they're not oriented optimally.  If your primary goal in installing home solar is a desire to produce renewable energy (for environmental reasons), almost any roof will do, &lt;strong&gt;as long as it's not shaded by other buildings or trees&lt;/strong&gt;.  If your goal in installing home solar is purely to save money, then you may care more about the modest losses from suboptimally-oriented panels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a typical plot of solar panel output, as a function of roof orientation (e.g. relative to the equator), and panel tilt (relative to horizontal):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/7QT4P.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/solar-panel-tilt-and-orientation-in-australia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/solar-panel-tilt-and-orientation-in-australia/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say your panels are tilted 32&amp;deg; from horizontal.  The graph shows that you get 100% of the maximum energy production if you point the panels North (this is an Australian chart).  But, if you point the panels Northeast or Northwest, at the same tilt angle, you're still easily within the white area indicating 90+% of the maximum energy production of your panels!  And even pointing due East or West, the worst possible orientation &lt;sup&gt;(&amp;#8225;)&lt;/sup&gt;, you're still producing about 85% of the maximum.  That's only a 15% loss, with a &lt;em&gt;&quot;bad&quot;&lt;/em&gt; roof orientation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Optimal Tilt Angle&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at the graph, you can also see that if you are pointed away from the equator, the optimal tilt angle also changes.  For example, on the above chart, if your roof points ENE (about 75&amp;deg;), then you'll get the highest output (90% of the max) with a tilt angle of less than 20&amp;deg;.  Pointing at the equator, the optimal tilt angle was about 32&amp;deg;. So, as your roof points away from the equator, a more shallow tilt angle (flat panel) works better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More Locations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftexploring.com/solar-energy/tilt-angle3.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here's a table showing similar relative calculations at a variety of Latitudes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get the precise number for your location on Earth, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gisatnrel.nrel.gov/PVWatts_Viewer/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;US NREL's PVWatt tool&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pick your location on the world map&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scroll down in the little popup window and select &lt;strong&gt;Send to PVWatts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pick the &lt;strong&gt;Array Tilt&lt;/strong&gt; (pitch) and &lt;strong&gt;Array Azimuth&lt;/strong&gt; (direction roof points)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;strong&gt;Calculate&lt;/strong&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Record the total yearly AC energy (kWh) for this combination&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go back and change the &lt;strong&gt;Array Azimuth&lt;/strong&gt; for a different roof orientation, and see what the total yearly AC energy is now&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing this, you can compare the results for the direction (azimuth) your roof points, with the optimum (180&amp;deg; for Northern hemisphere, and 0&amp;deg; for Southern).  That will show more precisely &lt;em&gt;how much roof orientation matters&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it's not that much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can perform the same comparison with &lt;strong&gt;Array Tilt&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8225;) &lt;sub&gt;Technically, East - West is not the worst roof face to pick.  You could, for example, pick a North-facing roof in the Northern hemisphere.  My friends in California claim that this is somewhat common, as some people will choose to place their solar panels on the side of the roof that faces the street, so they can show off their &lt;em&gt;green-ness&lt;/em&gt;, rather than the side of the roof that's most efficient&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="486" LastEditorUserId="486" LastEditDate="2013-06-11T10:05:34.167" LastActivityDate="2013-06-11T10:05:34.167" />

Maybe #5 plastics don't have a high demand right now; it could sit for a long time, maybe months, maybe years depending on supply &amp;amp; demand. So to &lt;strong&gt;recycle&lt;/strong&gt; things that are not compostable should thus be the last choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for using a two terms that by generalizing could be categorized the same is to stimulate thought, after all this is about rethinking waste.  To &lt;strong&gt;Reuse&lt;/strong&gt; something is to use it over and over for the purpose it was intended.  Like a glass jar.  Once it can no longer be &lt;strong&gt;Reused&lt;/strong&gt; then it is time to get creative and &lt;strong&gt;Repurpose&lt;/strong&gt; it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;repurpose&lt;/strong&gt; is to use a tool for use as another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker.  My example of this would my the wallet which is actually a second generation &lt;strong&gt;repurposed&lt;/strong&gt; item.  I can't claim the creativity but it was a person out of Boulder, CO &quot;English Retreads&quot; that thought of &lt;strong&gt;repurposing&lt;/strong&gt; the worn-out inner-tubes that were beyond repair from a rafting company that rented them to go down the river on. The rafting business had &lt;strong&gt;repurposed&lt;/strong&gt; them from tractors that could no longer use them because they would become deformed after time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;repurpose&lt;/strong&gt; can create business, jobs, and income.  UC-Davis has a &lt;strong&gt;Repurpose&lt;/strong&gt; store adjacent to their University store which sells ladies handbags made out of the heavy duty high end plastic shopping bags one may find in Sax Fifth Ave., etc. (they are making money doing so!). There are magazines, websites (instructables &amp;amp; many more) and even fair's (the Maker's Fair) that are dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;repurposing&lt;/strong&gt; what otherwise would be trash or recycling. By getting creative and thinking a bit out of the box you are cutting down on waste and you are saving energy not hauling it away to the recycling center, dump or incinerator. This is the idea behind adding &lt;strong&gt;Repurpose&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to &lt;strong&gt;Reuse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't feel to &lt;strong&gt;reduce&lt;/strong&gt; needs any explanation or examples but let me know if so.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refuse&lt;/strong&gt; is at the very top, to get the consumer to think about what they are buying. I can't stand those hard-plastic &quot;clamshell&quot; designed packages that are impossible to open without a Ginsu and then can not &lt;strong&gt;Reuse&lt;/strong&gt; the odd thing and they are not &lt;strong&gt;recyclable&lt;/strong&gt;.

Water bottles, even if they are recyclable, the lids are not. &lt;strong&gt;Refuse&lt;/strong&gt; plastic-ware and plastic straws because they are not recyclable; there are biodegradable alternatives. If you've ever volunteered at a beach cleanup (if not check out surfriders) you know how many straws are out in the ocean.  &lt;strong&gt;Refuse&lt;/strong&gt; these items before you get to reducing other plastics. &lt;strong&gt;Refuse&lt;/strong&gt; the junk mail before it wastes the couriers time money, fossil fuels, etc. A very easy &lt;strong&gt;refuse&lt;/strong&gt; junk mail packet exists and can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stopwaste.org/home/index.asp?page=1193&quot;&gt;stopwaste.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.renewablesathome.com/reuse/repurposing-stuff&quot;&gt;A blog further stating the logic of two more R's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="610" LastEditorUserId="610" LastEditDate="2013-06-19T03:14:23.447" LastActivityDate="2013-06-19T03:14:23.447" CommentCount="4" />

This sounds like what your printer is doing after limited use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work around to use expired cartridges in your printer:&lt;/strong&gt; Your printer has a time and date which you can change on its settings.  Simply set the date back to before the expiration date of your cartridges.  This works with Canon and HP printers and more than likely any other Brand.  There it is, you have worked around it! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; There are re-fill kits you can buy for your cartridge.  I have never tried this, it seems as though it could be messy if you're not careful. There is a re-toner store that can be found all around (in the united states) called cartridgeworld.com. This saves you money as it is at least 50% the cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a program called PretonSaver Home Edition that saves your ink by decreasing the pixels in size or number without it being noticeable.

The pumping of air is energy intensive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;additional sludge: The aerobic digestion process creates sludge, consisting of non-digested matter and the aerobic bacteria.

Owners of turbines smaller than 100 kW were able to install three times the capacity removed and receive a bonus on top of the normal FiT for the first five years. For units of 100 kW-150 kW, owners could install twice the capacity removed and receive the same treatment. Under this programme 1480 turbines totalling 122 MW were replaced with 272 new turbines of 332 MW in sum. The second Danish repowering scheme ran from 2008-2011 and offered a premium on top of the normal tariff for replacing up to 175 MW of old turbines with new machines that had at least double the capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, one of the reasons for supporting repowering - better use of good wind sites - often did not apply. Owners of old wind farms could decommission their turbines and sell the resulting repowering certificates to other wind developers, who then applied the extra FiT to new projects elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“You just had to show you had decommissioned old turbines somewhere in Denmark,” says Sune Strøm, chief economist at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windpower.org/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Danish Wind Industry Association&lt;/a&gt;. “There was no geographical link.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Strøm, the system distorted the market value of old turbines and made the cost of compensating old investors artificially high.

This may be hard to do as rats can eat their way through various materials. Storing all food and garbage in metal containers will help.

You'll have to use very sturdy materials for this (metal or very thick wood). Rats are very good climbers so also check for holes at window frames and ceilings. Also check if there are no tree branches or bushes the rats can use to climb on your roof and access the house from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a cat.

To find the answer one must look at the bigger picture for it has to do with a number of contributing factors much larger than the bleaching of a piece of paper.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of these contributing factors is the fact that our current economic model puts zero value in nature or ecosystems.  It is based on a business mentality of survival of the fittest with “survival” meaning those that can make money in the economic conditions.  There is no benefit in conservation in a model that has no way of equating such with cost, profit, ROI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor is that the corporations had been given an exorbitant amount of power back in the late 1800’s.  Since this time, corporate power has increasingly gained traction in the political arena through (among other things) the power of lobbying, the landmark decision that  a corporation is a person and the filling out of the Cabinet by corporate VPs, CEOs, Board Members etc.  This ensures that the corporations’ best interests are looked out for when drafting and revising new bills. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the controlling powers in the tissue industry (wood pulp) are long-standing corporations that first made their mark in logging old growth forests such as Weyerhauser, GP and Kimberly Clark.  They like all corporations that profit off the exploitative harvesting of a natural resource that is exhaustible go through a boom and bust cycle.  When they run out of the natural resource their profit margins go down.  However, they maintain a high degree of power and influence in the political arena.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet another factor is that the pulp and paper business is what one may consider an old sector of the economy such as the railroads, mining, etc.  In such large corporations that began so long ago they are adverse to change and when they do it is much slower in comparison to say, nanotechnology.  They do not adapt well like the new sectors because their infrastructure has basically stayed the same for more than a century.  In contrast computers, chips, etc. have been made to adapt because their marketplace changes virtually overnight.       &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this big picture stuff have to do with unbleached toilet paper you ask?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Nearly everything. I have just laid out a number of factors and to summarize: The “power brokers” of the logging pulp and paper industry have no incentive to change. Their business model is adverse to change. The early industrial age business model was not designed like that of today's information age companies. Not previously mentioned there is also a large, powerful industrial chemical complex that doesn’t want to lose business that will be replaced with nothing. These corporations have to answer to the board members and stockholders about projected quarterly earnings. (However, we as consumers have the power to change this through our buying habits). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are several retail companies such as Seventh Generation and other reputable companies offer unbleached tissue but the price is expensive compared to bleached toilet paper (which is illogical unless you take into consideration the above and the next statements) .  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.betterworldshopper.com/topten.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seventh Generation is the #1 rated company on the planet&lt;/a&gt; based on their overall social and environmental records.  This rating is achieved by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.betterworldshopper.com/rankings.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;5 step process which starts with over 20 years worth of data collected&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.betterworldshopper.org/research.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a wide range of public, private and nonprofit sources.&lt;/a&gt; To be ethical costs money in a capitalist free-market economy that does not value natural resources and workers rights (hours, wage, age, etc.). This can be applied to many things that seem illogical like organic food.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is good news. Thanks to authors like Paul Hawkens and William McDonough there is progress. There are a number of think tanks around the world such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neweconomics.org/our-work/entry/environment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NEF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happyplanetindex.org/data/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Happy Planet Index&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Paecon&lt;/a&gt; and the Cambridge Trust for New Economic Thinking that are working together to create a new economic model that values nature.

If you're in that situation, then you basically get what the company who wrote the control panel's software decides to give you.  It's unlikely that building your own monitoring circuitry or software would be a good use of time, although if you're a DIY type, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sine.ni.com/cs/app/doc/p/id/cs-14872&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I might suggest looking at LabView&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenEnergyMonitor&lt;/a&gt; to create your own monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also unlikely that the software features that come with your system are going to be (or should be) a &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; factor in picking the system.  I personally would rank the kind of panels, the inverter hardware, the experience of the installers, the price, and specific tax incentives as more important than the amount and kind of data you can see on the control panel, or web interface that the system supports.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples from some systems available where I live:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/public/systems/ZHN8479&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/public/systems/ZHN8479&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenraysolar.com/sites/default/files/GreenRay-SunTrakMonitoringSystem.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.greenraysolar.com/sites/default/files/GreenRay-SunTrakMonitoringSystem.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://documents.locusenergy.com/SolarOS-Site_Owner_App_Product_Sheet.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://documents.locusenergy.com/SolarOS-Site_Owner_App_Product_Sheet.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civicsolar.com/resource/solar-energy-pv-monitoring-options&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.civicsolar.com/resource/solar-energy-pv-monitoring-options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of what you should watch, I think solar panels are a bit like a car.  If you only want to watch &lt;strong&gt;one thing&lt;/strong&gt; to assess a car engine's health, watch your fuel consumption (e.g. miles per gallon, km/l, etc.).  With solar panels, &lt;code&gt;kWh&lt;/code&gt; produced per month is probably the equivalent metric.  That number can be affected by a few different factors, but if the number is close to the output when your panels were first installed (adjusted for &lt;em&gt;expected degradation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&amp;#8225;&lt;/sup&gt;), that's a good indication that the whole system is functioning reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://evaluatesolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Enphase-Enlighten.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Some systems allow you to see the production &lt;em&gt;per module&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can help identify one bad module in your array.  Having electronics on each module helps both with fine-grained monitoring, but also allows micro-inverters or DC-DC converters to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracking&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tune each's module's performance&lt;/a&gt; independently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another metric that may be available to you is panel &lt;strong&gt;temperature&lt;/strong&gt;.  Excessive temperature can be a sign of problems, and high temperatures can damage photovoltaics, like many electronics.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also be able to see the panel &lt;strong&gt;output voltage&lt;/strong&gt;, or the &lt;strong&gt;frequency&lt;/strong&gt; (Hz) of the power your inverter is producing.  Familiarize yourself with the normal values for your system, and note any deviations from that baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, your system may have a separate &lt;strong&gt;status&lt;/strong&gt; output that indicates that a particular module's health is Ok, Failed, Degraded, or Unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sunshine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the solar panels can only convert energy from what the sun gives them.  Variations in weather do make a difference, so if your panel output this month is 5% lower than the output from the same month last year, that doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the climate data &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/mcdw/mcdw.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;aggregated at the US National Climatic Data Center&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Note: this isn't just US data ... it's global&lt;/em&gt;).  If you open up the PDF file for a given month (there's a couple month delay in the published data), find a city near you, and look at the far right column to see total hours of sunshine:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/vSUnm.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the row I highlighted, the monthly sunshine was 26% higher than average for that month.  So, in that case, you'd expect your monthly output to be higher than most years.  This is a rough way to assess performance, but it's better than simply comparing to the same month last year, without adjusting for sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some off-the-shelf software monitoring systems do interface with weather and climate data services, and show some measure of sunshine.  The ones I've seen show instantaneous &lt;em&gt;solar irradiance&lt;/em&gt;, which I don't think is as useful as longer term sunshine data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;(&amp;#8225;) Expected Performance Loss&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to know what to expect from a solar PV system.  Panel performance will degrade slowly, and smoothly, over time, so that's to be anticipated.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/47704.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;From the US National Renewable Energy Lab, 2010&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/adFrz.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, depending on the kind of photovoltaics you use, and when they were built, you might &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; a 1/2% loss in output per year, or it might be 2% per year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inverter problems may show up more abruptly, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solarenergyexperts.co.uk/buyersguides/solar-panel-problems-troubleshooting/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;before the photovoltaics reach their end of life&lt;/a&gt;.

The flood and drain system described by Earthling is one, very popular, style of system.  It success is due to the fact that the grow bed where the plants are living is slowly filled, and then quickly drained.  This quick draining pulls oxygen into the bed.  This effectively is providing three things to the plant in a constant fashion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An unlimited supply of oxygen&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nutrients from the fish (more on how in a second)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An unlimited supply of water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nutrients that the plants need come somewhat indirectly from the fish.  The fish go the bathroom.  This causes the ammonia levels to build up in the water.  There is a bacteria that will establish itself in the system which will convert this ammonia into nitrites.  Once the water starts to have a certain level of nitrites in it another bacteria will establish itself.  This second set of bacteria convert the nitrites into nitrates.  The nitrates are what feeds the plants.  This bacteria lives in the edges of the substrate/media.  This media is usually a type of rock or manufactured rock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is the first half of the story.  The process described above feeds the plants.  But it is also helping to clean the water for the fish!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The water moving around splashing all over in the system is what cleans out the carbon dioxide that the fish deposit in the water as they breath.  Sometimes there are issues in having enough of this process present in the natural motion of the system in which case a bubbler is also introduced.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only input to a well crafted aquaponics system is the food for the fish.  But clever people have figured out ways around that too using black soldier fly larvae!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other systems you might look at, which are similar in process, are grow towers.  In the towers case you would use a sponge like material similar to what you would find in a bio filter in an aquarium.  The ideas being the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there are systems that don't use grow media at all.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://aquaponics.wikia.com/wiki/Nutrient_Film_Technique&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NFT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://aquaponics.wikia.com/wiki/Deep_Water_Culture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DWC&lt;/a&gt; are a couple of examples.  These are closer to hydroponics.  The water is constantly on the roots of the plants without ever having a break.  In this type of system you need two additional concepts.  You need a media based bio filter similar to that of the towers but you wouldn't plant your plants in them.  The water flows through them allowing the bacteria to clean the water.  And immediately after the fish tanks you have some form of solids filter.  In many cases this comes in the form of a swirl filter where the water goes round and round allowing the big poops to fall to the bottom of the tank.  In a system like this you usually would have to remove the big solid waste now and then.  Some folks dump this directly into a grow bed so as not to have a waste being generated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NFT: Nutrient Film Technique - the plants sit in a very long and very shallow tube with holes cut in it or tray (much like a rain gutter) that has a top on it also with holes cut in it.  Nutrient rich water is trickled from one end of the tube to the other end in a constant flow - just enough water for the roots to drink from.  Plants sit in the holes every foot or so (depending on what you are growing) with their roots just touching the bottom of the tube.  This allows maximum fresh air to get to the roots as the water pulls it in as it travels.  The roots eventually grow into the tube and lay in the water.  Two immediate down sides to this technique is that 1) without appropriate filtering, solids can get stuck on the roots and eventually cake the root disallowing uptake of nutrients, water, and oxygen and 2) in hot and cold climates the water that enters the tube is at the temperature you specify but can be drastically different once it reaches the other end some 50-100' away.  This can cook the roots or freeze out the roots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DWC: Deep Water Culter - this is very much the same thing as NFT in principle but on a totally different scale.  Two big differences with this approach is that rather than planting in a small tube you plant in a huge trough of water.  The trough might be equally long 50-100' (or more) but the trough is also 4-5' wide and at least 12&quot; deep.  The water also enters one end and exits on the other end.  Another major difference is that the plants sit on a foam (usually) raft with holes cut in the raft.  The plants sit in plastic cups and almost their entire root body hands into the water totally submerged.  Filtering is still an issue but in aquaponics there are many that are running their water through a grow bed or grow tower prior to entering the DWC tank.  This way you don't loose the good stuff that is filtered.  And because of the sheer volume of water it doesn't tend to fluctuate in temperature nearly as much.  Also - having that much water means that keeping the chemical balance is usually easier.  One down side in some dwc systems is lack of oxygenation.  You can design bubbling spots in your plumbing and system but many people add additional pumps with bubble stones directly to the grow tank which aids in off gassing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="45" LastEditorUserId="45" LastEditDate="2013-06-27T03:27:03.763" LastActivityDate="2013-06-27T03:27:03.763" CommentCount="0" />

To be most useful to a general audience, &lt;em&gt;not just this question's asker&lt;/em&gt;, I'll mention a couple rough methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you should track your energy choices in general is fairly simple:  monitor your energy bills monthly, &lt;strong&gt;before and after&lt;/strong&gt; making the change (in this case, before and after installing the solar hot water system).  Energy utilities are often quite good at giving you detailed information on your bill.   While this method is rough, and fails when you make multiple changes at once (e.g. add a baby at the same time that you add solar hot water), it also has the benefit of encompassing all losses in the system, which you will not get if you only monitor &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; at the panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could conduct a short experiment, and then extrapolate results to get your monthly, or yearly savings.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The experiment might involve switching off all other electric devices in the house (I recommend doing so at the circuit breakers, not by unplugging appliances individually).  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leave your hot water system to operate normally.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a simple thermometer, take some cold water from your tap to measure its temperature.  Note the hot water setting at your house if you have a fixed &lt;em&gt;setpoint&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. 60&amp;deg;C), or measure it again by drawing &lt;strong&gt;hot&lt;/strong&gt; water from the tank's drain valve, or a nearby faucet.  Now you have your &amp;Delta;T (change in water temperature).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the hot water at equilibrium (after the tank temperature is stable ... not right after a shower, or running the clothes washer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Record the initial electricity reading at your home's meter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have your family take your normal daily showers.  Note the exact length of the showers, in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a few hours, or until you're sure that water tank temperature has recovered to the steady state value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll need to know the flow rate of your shower.  It should be stamped on the shower head itself, but you may need to calibrate that number with a separate experiment: run the shower into a large bucket of known size and time how long it takes to fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this information, you can determine that total water consumed is equal to the total shower time in seconds, times the flow rate in liters per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, measure electricity consumed at the house meter.  Subtract the initial reading to get total grid electricity consumed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total heat added to the water is the volume of water used, times &amp;rho; (1 kg/liter), times &amp;Delta;T, times the heat capacity of water (1 calorie / gram / &amp;deg;C).  The heat added by the solar system is approximately the total heat, minus the heat added by the electrical heater.  You measured the &lt;strong&gt;electrical energy&lt;/strong&gt; input, so &lt;strong&gt;heat&lt;/strong&gt; input from the electric element will be that number, multiplied by the electric water heater's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_factor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Energy Factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want your food to start spoiling during the experiment, simply get one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plug-in power meter&lt;/a&gt; to use with your refrigerator, so you can measure and subtract the fridge's energy from the meter reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to also run through a cycle with your clothes washer, or dish washer, then add them to the experiment.  Again, use a plug-in meter on the appliance when it's being used, so you can separate that energy usage from what you read at the home's meter.  If your dish washer has an option to provide water heat, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/850/486&quot;&gt;which I don't tend to use&lt;/a&gt;, you might turn that off for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a clothes washer, if it drains to a utility sink, you can stop the sink up, and monitor how many times it fills (opening the sink before it overflows, of course), to measure the water consumed during a &lt;strong&gt;hot&lt;/strong&gt; cycle.  I'm guessing you have a cold rinse, which you wouldn't want to measure for this test.  Cycles that mix hot and cold might be harder to measure ... I'll have to get back to you on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the dish washer, you might just have to search for manufacturer's data on your model, to see how much hot water per cycle it uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Extrapolating&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you just perform this experiment once, it's obviously dependent on how sunny that day was.  Repeating the experiment several times, during different seasons/conditions, can allow you to get an average result.  You could also try to simply determine what the day's sunshine was like, relative to the average.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have access to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/pyr-bta/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pyranometer&lt;/a&gt;, you can measure sunshine during the experiment, and compare it to other days (the other days can simply be to monitor sunshine, without the hot water tests).  You can also lookup &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/mcdw/mcdw.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;climate data for your location&lt;/a&gt; to determine how sunny your area is, month by month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this information, you can determine that during your test, your output might be 10% above normal, or 25% below normal, and use that adjustment when you multiply by 30, or 365 to get monthly and yearly estimates.  Remember that if you add activities like clothes or dish washing, that don't happen &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt;, you'll need to account for that when projecting for the full month, or year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; if you do the experiment, and feel that your hot water temperature is not constant (not recovering all the way between uses), then you can make the results more precise by measuring hot water temperature at each step (each shower, each wash cycle, etc.) and performing the calculation for each hot water consuming activity separately, with a different &amp;Delta;T value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/1079/486&quot;&gt;EnergyNumbers is going to provide a more precise technique&lt;/a&gt; for measuring output (at the panels?), so I'll leave my answer with just these rough measures for approximating the answer.

An EV traction motor may very well last 1,000,000 miles, versus perhaps one quarter of that for most ICEs.  While it's true that current EVs tend to use batteries to power the motors, and batteries may need to be replaced at a comparable interval to an ICE timing belt, an EV with a new battery is going to run much more like a new vehicle than an ICE with a new timing belt.  The regenerative braking associated with the electric motor will also prolong brake life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric motors are more quiet than ICEs.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a controversial topic.  I believe noise pollution to be a problem, and thus, a quieter car to be better (especially with respect to &lt;em&gt;sustainability&lt;/em&gt;).  Some are concerned about pedestrian safety with quieter electric motors.  While this can be, and is being, addressed by adding noise makers to electric cars, I believe this solution is actually misguided.  The basis for this aversion to quiet cars partly draws from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811204.PDF&quot;&gt;multi-year study&lt;/a&gt; in the US concerning pedestrian accidents with hybrid vehicles.  The hybrid vehicles had a 40% higher rate of pedestrian accidents than non-hybrids.  However, the study did not correct for the fact that in the US, hybrids tend to be owned by city-dwellers, and the rate of pedestrian accidents is twice as high in cities vs. rural areas, for all cars.  I believe this factor alone can explain the 40% result.  Also, during this study, which involved thousands of hybrid cars, not a single blind person was killed by a quiet hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size matters&lt;/strong&gt;.  In an application-agnostic answer, it's important to note that for some applications, electric motors are more versatile because of the variety of sizes they come in.  Hopefully, it's obvious that an ICE to make your phone vibrate is not an option, but a motor works quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Disadvantages of Electric Motors&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without specifying your application, I'll try to discuss multiple transportation applications.  For cars or trains, the excess &lt;strong&gt;weight&lt;/strong&gt; of a battery pack that drives an electric motor is not a huge penalty.  The road provides extra normal force to balance the vehicle weight.  However, in aerospace applications, power-to-weight ratio is more critical.  So, for airplanes, using electric motors for propulsion is still not practical.  Liquid fuels have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aEnergy_density.svg&quot;&gt;higher energy density&lt;/a&gt; compared to batteries, which makes petro-fuels or biofuels more attractive for airborne propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is less of a problem for cars, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/media/rm237341696/tt0181689&quot;&gt;do not yet have to levitate&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, it should be noted that comparisons of energy density for liquid fuels vs. batteries distort the true picture, because &lt;strong&gt;total weight&lt;/strong&gt; is what's important, and an ICE system requires a heavy ICE, and a heavy transmission.  When the whole system is considered, battery EVs suffer a noticeable, but acceptable, weight penalty for their lower energy-density fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery range&lt;/strong&gt; (capacity) is also a problem for EVs.  However, I believe this issue to be exaggerated, as the average US driver (who drives a lot!) still only drives 40 miles on an average day.  In the future, more charging stations will also minimize the range problem for electric cars.  However, for now, range versatility has to be considered an advantage of ICE vehicles.  An interesting compromise is made by Chevy's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chevrolet.com/volt-electric-car.html&quot;&gt;Volt EV&lt;/a&gt;, which is fundamentally an electric car, but which carries an on-board generator for recharging the battery by burning liquid petro-fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt; constraints can be a disadvantage for electric motors, &lt;em&gt;due to the batteries themselves&lt;/em&gt;.  High temperatures can shorten battery life, and very low temperatures can (temporarily) reduce the useful capacity of the battery.  Note that &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; temperatures here on earth are well-suited to battery EVs, so this issue is more a problem if your area has temperature extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Economic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is difficult to answer without a more specific question.  Electric motors will draw their fuel from different sources than internal combustion engines.  Each country will have different economics regarding their electric grid, and oil consumption.  If your country has more abundant resources to produce electricity (coal, natural gas, solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear), you may consider electric motors an economic benefit.  If you're in an oil country, maybe not.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you add biofuels to the mix, you add agriculture as a factor.  Most internal combustion engines can use varying levels of biofuels.  An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/sughoshdeshmukh/ethanol-engine-modifications&quot;&gt;Otto cycle engine needs modest engine modifications to run rich ethanol blends&lt;/a&gt;.  Many modern diesel engines need no modifications to run biodiesel (although winter cold can limit the blend).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, ICEs can provide a domestic economic boost if your country can grow its own biofuel feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that pollution (which includes greenhouse gas) and energy efficiency are the most important factors here, and those favor electric motors for many applications.  EnergyNumbers' answer covers those well.

Key strategies for consuming less in this sort of transportation are therefore to&#xA;  weigh less, and to go further between stops. Regenerative braking,&#xA;  which captures energy when slowing down, may help too. In addition, it&#xA;  helps to move slower, and to move less.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In long-distance travel at steady speed, by train or automobile, most&#xA;  of the energy goes into making air swirl around, because you only&#xA;  have to accelerate the vehicle once. The key strategies for consuming&#xA;  less in this sort of transportation are therefore to move slower, and to&#xA;  move less, and to use long, thin vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In all forms of travel, there’s an energy-conversion chain, which takes&#xA;  energy in some sort of fuel and uses some of it to push the vehicle forwards. Inevitably this energy chain has inefficiencies. In a standard fossil-fuel car, for example, only 25% is used for pushing, and&#xA;  roughly 75% of the energy is lost in making the engine and radiator&#xA;  hot. So a final strategy for consuming less energy is to make the&#xA;  energy-conversion chain more efficient.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These observations lead us to six principles of vehicle design and vehicle use for more-efficient surface transport:&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  a) reduce the frontal area per person; &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  b) reduce the vehicle’s weight per person; &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  c) when traveling, go at a steady speed and avoid using brakes; &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  d) travel more slowly; &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  e) travel less;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  and &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  f) make the energy chain more efficient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  We’ll now discuss a variety of ways to apply these principles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that a pickup truck operating on railroad tracks would get a benefit from traveling at a steady speed for longer distances, but would still be at a disadvantage compared to trains in that: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not long and thin (does not pull more people or freight in its wake, after it has already done the work of moving the air in front of it). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its drive train (internal combustion engine) is not efficient as a train's electric drive (powered by a diesel generator, but still more efficient).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also an advantage of using railroad wheels on rails instead of rubber on concrete. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance&lt;/a&gt;, the railroad wheels have a coefficient of rolling resistance of 0.0010 to 0.0024; while car tires on concrete get 0.010 to 0.015. The resistive force is proportional to this coefficient, and various websites list rolling resistance as about 5% of the energy loss in on-road vehicles, so by my calculations, this aspect of running a truck on rails rather than on the road might save you 4-5%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="645" LastEditorUserId="645" LastEditDate="2013-07-03T14:09:47.940" LastActivityDate="2013-07-03T14:09:47.940" CommentCount="3" />

Air is introduced and the ink sticks to the air bubbles, which rise to the top. The ink bubbles are then skimmed of the top and the fibres are processed into recycled paper (newspaper, for example). This might be a nice little project, but I doubt anyone has the stamina to make recycled paper at home. The outcome will be pretty, but certainly not printable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In principle, paper can be composted as well, but the fibres are usually bleached, which already introduces some chemicals into the paper. Most inks also contain harmful chemicals, so composting might not be the best idea. In a sense, composting paper could also be seen to be a waste. It takes a lot to get trees into paper form. Ending the life-cycle of the fibres by composting reduces the availability of recycled paper, and is at least partly responsible for chopping down more trees.

By cloth, I mean we printed t shirts and used scrap t shirts to make the filters - just wrap 3-4 layers of t shirts around a screen printing screen and that's the filter (6-8 layers of cloth, one layer of ~0.5mm mesh). We had effectively a split tank with the filter at the top of the separating barrier, so water flowed through the filter into the &quot;clean&quot; side. It definitely was never drinkable, the hydrocarbons from the inks stayed in the water and made it smell bad forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found the settling tank did 90% of the work, what was left was very fine ink particles and some floating debris. The cloth filter got that out very effectively, and we changed that when it was obviously holding the water back - the level on the &quot;clean&quot; side was much lower than on the dirty side. Or when we had a pile of discarded t shirts. I'd just roughly cut the sleeves and printed front off, then use the clean back sections on the filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our system was smaller than yours, our tank was only about 300 litres. But if you already have a 2 cubic metre tank and can get another one I suggest trying a setup like the one we used. Put the &quot;clean&quot; tank a little lower than the existing dirty one, have the overflow from the dirty tank run over/through the filter, and see how it goes. If you're using cloth I suggest a frame with cloth resting on wire mesh, so it's easy to see how clean the cloth is and change it when required. Make sure the overflow from that filter is able to take the full flow out of the dirty tank, because the filter will get blocked at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the settling/dirty tank got too full of &quot;gunk&quot; that had settled out we would drain most of the water out using a syphon, then when the siphon was sucking up dirty water we'd stop it and dispose of the rest.

Only new material–made of&#xA;  virgin carbon fiber–is strong enough for fabrication of&#xA;  flight-critical components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The carbon composites are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swrtec.de/swrtec/team/recyclingposter.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;heated to around 400 &amp;deg;C - 600 &amp;deg;C&lt;/a&gt;, so the epoxy resin can be burned off (and lost), and the fibers reclaimed.  Although the end result is not a fiber of the same length as the original, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/carbon-fiber-reclamation-going-commercial&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;process only uses about 5% of the energy that the original manufacturing process did.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like when paper is recycled, the resulting fibers get shorter and shorter, and this reduces the strength of the recycled composite material.  They are still usable, but not for all the same applications (e.g. aircraft structure) as the original material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An early, lower-tech recycling process for carbon fiber simply involved grinding it up, and using it as filler material for applications like road building.  Less demanding applications like laptop cases are also current recipients of recycled carbon fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Consumer Products&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the material performance demands are highest for aerospace applications, then automotive applications, then sporting goods, and finally consumer electronics.

The peak load occurs with a certain lag after a certain amount of rain within a limited period. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To function effectively for gardening, a water storage system should retain the maximum amount of water at any given point, which conflicts with the stormwater requirements.

I think rain barrels are great water saving devices, and can provide &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; buffer against run-off.  They're also cheap and easy to install, and can often repurpose existing containers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I would still answer &lt;strong&gt;&quot;No, they should not be considered substitutes for rain gardens in building codes&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to understand what the purpose of a building code is.  It's not a way to create the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; possible residential units.  It's a means to provide sort of a &lt;em&gt;lowest-common-denominator&lt;/em&gt; solution.  A &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; acceptable standard for something - in this case, stormwater management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone such as yourself, who's in tune with these issues, an active gardener, and motivated to consider sustainability, might very well be able to improve upon the building code's solutions.  But, the code isn't so much for &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, as it is for those who don't care about this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For rain barrels to perform a stormwater management function, requires some active management on your part.  As &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/1130/486&quot;&gt;Highly Irregular said&lt;/a&gt;, you have to watch the fill level of your barrels constantly.  Most residents won't do this reliably.   A 55 gallon rain barrel can fill up fast, so it's easy to envision that in a short time, it might have &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; benefit for stormwater management.  If the barrel is full, and has to drain via the overflow tube, you get absolutely no drainage benefit.  The rain garden is much more work to setup, but in my opinion, once it's working, it should continue to function with less intervention, compared to the rain barrel.  If the right native species are planted, once established, you should only have to make sure somebody doesn't completely mow over the garden.  Any other maintenance should be few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, building codes primarily serve to govern plans for &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; buildings.  When you have an empty lot that's yet to be landscaped, it's less work to install a good rain garden.  After the home/building and yard are complete, and you want to add &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; water management, I think rain barrels offer a reasonable retrofit solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Parallels&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, this also reminds me of &lt;em&gt;geoengineering&lt;/em&gt; solutions, which I generally tend to be opposed to.  For example, a proposal to combat global warming by injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere.  True, this would block sunlight, which would have a cooling effect.  But, sun is a good thing.  Blocking it would have other detrimental effects, and this &quot;&lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt;&quot; does nothing to fight the non-warming problems associated with increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels (e.g. ocean acidification).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actively managed rain barrels might serve the purpose of stormwater management, but a plastic barrel isn't a plant.  Rain gardens are also good because they involve planting native species, keeping greenspace green instead of turning it into concrete, patio or deck area, and they also promote good biodiversity.  Rain barrels by themselves don't do these things.  The only thing they're assured of doing is saving some water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saving water is good.  I use rain barrels, and especially recommend them for retrofits, where the yard is already planted (with or without rain garden).  I just don't think they're a &lt;em&gt;substitute&lt;/em&gt; for rain gardens in building codes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="486" LastActivityDate="2013-07-18T01:24:19.900" />

The container from previous point does not have this property. If I want to get a bag from the middle or the bottom of it, I need to take out all bags above the one I want. That's just irritating and it's the drawback of the vast majority of bag containers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I want to have all bags visible - that's similar to previous one, I want to see all the bags, so I can quickly spot and then take the one I want.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought of using a few containers, each one for different type of a bag, but after some time I discarded this idea - there are too many types and I would need to have ~10 containers in order to compensate for their drawbacks mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hadn't yet tried it, but I found an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p7-P6l2fus&quot;&gt;interesting video&lt;/a&gt; which shows a flag-like folding method.

The two are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason is kind of a corollary to an argument that's common &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/divisionoflaborspecialization.html&quot;&gt;in economics&lt;/a&gt;.  The argument is that an economy works better when each of us specialize in what we're good at, and leave the other work for people with different talents.  If you're really great at growing tomatoes, I suggest you take up tomato farming.  If you're better at something else, do that for a living.  In economics, you do have different priorities (vs. sustainability).  However, they're not completely unrelated.  Economic efficiency focuses on costs.  Sustainability focuses on energy, pollution and finite resources.  But energy and resources cost money, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The organic tomato farmer is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; trying to run a successful business.  They don't want to use more energy, water, organic fertilizer, or land than they need to.  They'll try to minimize those things, and given their experience, will likely do a better job than you do.  Economies of scale matter.  It's hard to have economies of scale in a backyard garden.  Do it if you love to garden, or want the freshest possible food.  But, don't assume it's most sustainable.  You should plant the kind of plants in your yard that are native to your area, or provide habitat for birds, insects or animals we &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; need more of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psufoodscience.typepad.com/psu_food_science/files/es702969f.pdf&quot;&gt;Here's also a link about the relative importance of &quot;food miles&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the energy equation, which I think tends to be overrated.  For example, if transportation to market represents only 4% of greenhouse gas emissions for a certain food, are you sure your home farming won't be more than 4% less efficient than the professional farmer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Misconceptions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There also appear to be a few assumptions in the question that I'd challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a cat or dog &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be sustainable&lt;/strong&gt; (if not for allergies, or lazy cat syndrome).  If a dog or cat is active enough to be any good at chasing squirrels (and probably only when they're young), then they'll need a high-energy diet.  Such a pet, pound-for-pound, is going to consume much more food energy than a human.  Food takes energy, land, water, and soil to grow.  Pets can have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://phys.org/news176582720.html&quot;&gt;large negative environmental impact&lt;/a&gt;, even though they're &quot;natural&quot;.  Keeping one just to protect your tomatoes would be like buying a schoolbus to drive to the grocery store, but claiming it's sustainable because it's a hybrid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shooting squirrels would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;.  I vehemently defend species under threat from human activity, but not all animals fall into this category.  Mankind has generally chased away the squirrel's natural predators, so in many areas people live, squirrel populations have increased.  Thus, killing squirrels isn't necessarily unsustainable (especially if you, or local birds, eat them).  Yes, squirrels do help propagate trees, but where you live, there's a good chance that humans decide which trees get planted, and which are removed.  If humans perform this function, we can probably tolerate a reduction in the number of squirrels doing so as well.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peta.org/issues/wildlife/squirrels.aspx&quot;&gt;For balance, I'll link to PETA's defense of squirrels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing your own peppers would be better&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is really just about the &lt;em&gt;specialization&lt;/em&gt; argument again, and how doing everything yourself isn't the point of sustainability, and usually isn't efficient.  The relative sustainability gains you might achieve in growing your own peppers are likely small compared to the losses of growing crops that are eaten by overpopulated rodents.  Worry about the tomato problem first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;If you really need a narrow answer to this question ...&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might need to provide more information.  &lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; are tomato cages not practical for you?  We may need to understand this is in order to give you another recommendation.  Cages would have been my suggestion, and in general, I think the MNN article covers most good alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="486" LastActivityDate="2013-07-20T22:14:19.007" CommentCount="10" />

I would not be surprised to find them in some of the more rural supermarkets as well, but the easy place to start is online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a horticultural area in NZ and we did a lot of preserving because fruit was cheap in season. Mostly we used what the posters above are calling &quot;Mason jars&quot;, but the brand names are different in NZ and my extended family didn't refer to them by brand name, just as preserving jars and preserving lids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For seals I've used wax extensively in the past when we used to make a lot of fruit preserve and it worked well. The main failure mode was content shrinkage pulling the wax down out of the neck of the jar. The solution is to put the wax where the sides are parallel (which limits the jars you can use), and you usually have a fair bit of airspace, but IMO better that waste than spoiled preserves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I was starting to collect jars now I would be very tempted by the coffee jars with glass lids and low-quality plastic seals (Moccona is one brand that's available in NZ). Use wax for the real seal, only put the lid on once the jar is cool. But first, get a couple of jars and make sure they will cope with the heat of preserving. The reason for this is that the jars are pretty readily available second hand/free. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wax, by the way, can be collected and reused with a little effort. Or keep bees and get it free :) Since we had a beekeeper visit us every spring to pollinate fruit we used to buy wax and honey off him at the same time. But we still re-used the wax, either for preserving or in candles. The trick is to use a metal fish slice to cut a little groove into the wax without breaking the seal, invert the jar to tip the wax shavings out, then push down to crack it into two pieces that can be lifted out of the jar whole. That way you don't end up mixing lots of little fragments into the jam (my little sisters preferred the &quot;hulk smash&quot; approach that made the top few centimetres of jam quite waxy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I commented above but decided 300 words of comments was enough to make this an answer, so sorry for the duplication).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="659" LastEditorUserId="659" LastEditDate="2013-07-24T02:16:46.137" LastActivityDate="2013-07-24T02:16:46.137" CommentCount="1" />

This approach doesn't work very well in an electric car, but it has worked well in clocks for hundreds of years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many power plants use the &quot;falling weight&quot; approach in the form of water. The water is pumped uphill to a lake at night when the power plant has excess capacity. During high-demand daytime periods, the water runs through a turbine on its way downhill to a lower lake.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another way to store energy is in some form of repeatable mechanical deformation. This is the idea behind a spring used in a wind-up clock or a rubber band used in a wind-up airplane. You store the energy by bending (deforming) the material in a spring, and the material releases the energy as it returns to its original shape. At the scale of a car, this technology has problems because of the weight of the spring, but at smaller scales (like a wristwatch) it works great. See also this page for an interesting example.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nature has been storing energy for a long time, and if you want to think about it in this way, gasoline is really a form of stored energy. Plants absorb sunlight and turn it into carbohydrates (see How Food Works for a discussion of carbohydrates). Over millions of years, these carbohydrates can turn into oil or coal. On a more human time scale, we burn wood (which is a carbohydrate) to release stored energy, or turn corn into alcohol and burn the alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another technique that nature uses to store energy is fat, which many of us are familiar with in a personal way. It is interesting to think about a car that somehow eats grass or some other carbohydrate and stores it as fat!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can take energy and split water into its hydrogen and oxygen atoms using electrolysis. By storing the hydrogen and oxygen in tanks, you can later create energy by burning it, or (more efficiently) by running it through a fuel cell (see How Fuel Cells Work).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can use the energy to spin up a flywheel and then later extract the energy by using the flywheel to run a generator. This patent has lots of information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can store heat directly and later convert the heat to another form of energy like electricity. This page discusses some of NASA's experiments in this area.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can use compressed air to store energy. Toys like the Air Hog store energy in this way. Compressing gases like nitrogen enough produces liquid nitrogen, and this page talks about how you can use liquid nitrogen to power a car.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of the new technologies that may become available in the future involves antimatter. When you combine normal matter with antimatter, you get energy. You store the energy by creating the antimatter. This page talks about it a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find the compressed air or water an interesting idea. Is it possible to compress air or water during the day using photo-voltaic power and then generating power at night by decompressing air or water? Water especially can be interesting in combination with rainwater harvesting. But is that efficient? Are any of the above more efficient and cost effective than batteries?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="144" LastEditorUserId="144" LastEditDate="2013-09-02T01:36:20.397" LastActivityDate="2013-09-02T14:48:25.010" Title="Cost-effective alternative to rechargeable batteries?"

Energy can be stored at pretty much any scale you like, and cost is typically the constrainer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are additional constraints for within-household energy storage: in particular, safety, space and noise. Safety and space will rule out most forms of energy storage: high-energy-density solutions tend to be prone to bad accidents, precisely because they have high energy density.  And low energy density solutions need a lot of space, which is typically limited in households.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Electricity is hard&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storing electricity, to use as electricity, is a pain at the household level. The constraints above, rule out most of the energy storage solutions proposed in the question. It either takes too much space, or is too highly concentrated, creating a major safety risk.  There are some forms of highly concentrated energy that we have proven means of safe storage: but the capital costs for the round trip from electricity to storage to electricity are high, and the efficiencies are low, making the whole exercise very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These constraints rule out pretty much all the suggested methods in the question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Towards a solution: start with the biggest energy uses&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First look at your biggest energy uses. They are likely to be either heating, or cooling, or both. The good news is that they are easy to store, as low-grade heat or coolth, for 24-48 hours. Possibly more, if you can build some large underground storage.  Rich ancient Romans managed year-round thermal storage with large underground ice houses and heat stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your biggest energy uses are also the place to start looking for energy efficiencies too. If you're planning energy storage, then the business case for efficiencies starts looking much better, because you get two sets of savings: the reduced energy costs, and reduced cost of your energy storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Virtual storage&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the timing of energy use can be shifted, then that acts as virtual storage, with 100% efficiency. It may also require little capital investment - maybe a timer or two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Storage efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency in and of itself isn't necessarily a meaningful number: it has a direct impact on costs, which do matter. But in its own right, higher is not always better. If all other things are equal (and they rarely are), then higher is generally better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Forms of energy&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not all forms of energy are equal. Some, such as low-grade heat or coolth, are easy to store, but can't do much work. Others, such as electricity, are capable of doing a lot of work (electricity is a high-exergy vector), but are very expensive to store directly (supercapacitors). Converting between forms of energy is always less than 100% efficient, and can be expensive.  Similarly, DC electricity and AC electricity are different: conversion each way is less than 100% efficient, and requires dedicated equipment that can be bulky, expensive, noisy, etc. Batteries convert DC electricity to chemical energy for storage, and back again for use; but most household appliances run on AC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;One sketch of a solution&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do as much energy-efficiency measures as are practicable: LED lights yielding over 100 lumens per watt, lots of thermal insulation, high-efficiency white goods, making the most of natural ventilation, solar gain, and night-time cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;run all your heating through a large thermal store, which you charge up whenever energy is readily available. Do the same, as far as possible, with a large ice store, for your cooling needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find someone who's converted their household electricity distribution system to DC as much as possible, and has worked out which devices can be run direct off DC. Then copy their successes, and learn from their failures. Find the cheapest chemical batteries (probably lead-acid car batteries as of 2013), and use for round-trip electricity storage. If you have to, get a rectifier and an inverted to do the DC/AC two wa conversion too.

Depending on the type of surface, it can either push water through the top layer (eg with a chip seal), or wash away away some of the fine material which binds the surface together (eg with an unsealed road). In both cases, this can cause damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the key ways of preventing damage is to provide a slope (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_slope&quot;&gt;cross-fall&lt;/a&gt;) for the water to drain away. I think a gravel (ie unsealed) road requires a higher cross-fall than a sealed road, which makes some sense (the material tends to shift around more, so could more easily puddle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the water needs to be able to drain away from the side of the road without eroding it or softening it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Limiting speed of traffic over a wet or damaged road should reduce further damage. A neat psychological trick for doing this is to provide lanes that feel narrow for traffic to drive through. The narrower it feels, the slower people driver. You can make it feel narrower by using taller and more conspicuous sides (eg like the movable barriers in the photo rather than just road cones).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to understand what damage has been done from a photo taken in such wet weather.

Used cooking oil can be processed into biodiesel by a modestly savvy do-it-yourselfer at home, with a simple processor that you can build yourself out of parts you'll find at most hardware stores (plus maybe a pump from an industrial supply store like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harborfreight.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Harbor Freight in the US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The complete plans are beyond the scope of this question, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://make-biodiesel.org/The-Appleseed-Biodiesel-Processor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;you can find good information online here&lt;/a&gt;.  Basically, someone who drives a diesel vehicle can turn an electric hot water heater and a 55-gallon (rinse) barrel into a biodiesel processor for cooking oil.  The recipe would usually involve adding some methanol, and a catalyst like KOH.  You would make batches of &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; 50 gallons of fuel at a time.  Certainly, your own cooking oil would not be enough to provide feedstock for this, but if you added your oil to that collected from local, independently-operated (&amp;dagger;) restaurants, you can have a more sustainable way to reuse the oil, compared with consuming gasoline or petro-diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type of process can supply biodiesel that can be run in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utahbiodieselsupply.com/blog/best-diesel-vehicles-for-biodiesel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;Dagger;) diesel engine vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, with little or no modifications (older diesel vehicles will probably need new synthetic rubber fuel lines if they had natural rubber lines before).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Waste Vegetable Oil (not biodiesel) as Fuel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to have to add to your supply with used restaurant oil, another option for people with diesel vehicles is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-convert-your-diesel-to-run-on-vegetable-oil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;buy/install a conversion kit&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to use (filtered) waste vegetable oil &lt;strong&gt;directly&lt;/strong&gt; in the vehicle.  Basically, the car starts on normal diesel or biodiesel.  Once the engine comes up to temperature, you flip a switch, and the fuel is then drawn from an auxiliary waste veggie oil (WVO) tank.  You normally would switch back to diesel/biodiesel before shutting down just to purge the lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number of diesel vehicles eligible for WVO conversions is a bit smaller, though, and as opposed to using biodiesel, which has superior &lt;em&gt;cleansing&lt;/em&gt; properties to petro-diesel, using WVO needs to be done more carefully, because you can gunk up your engine.  Older Mercedes diesels (1970s - 1990s) seem to do the best on WVO, compared to other cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Oil Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you use cooking oil to power a diesel engine, you do want to pick good oils.  Generally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://make-biodiesel.org/Ingredients/biodiesel-feedstock-oils.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that turns out to be the same kinds of oils that are more healthy for people&lt;/a&gt;.  Veggie oils are better than animal oils.  No solid fats.  Cooking oil can be reused, and restaurants do reuse it.  The more it's reused for cooking, the more rancid and more contaminated with food stuffs, the less desirable it is for fuel feedstock.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Oil Handling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll want to collect it in clean metal or HDPE containers (5 gallon &quot;carboys&quot; work well).  At home, you need &lt;a href=&quot;http://make-biodiesel.org/Quality-Testing/titrating-wvo.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to test your oil before using&lt;/a&gt; (for example, to see if one restaurant's product is typically usable).  The oil then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greasecar.com/article/one-mans-trash-another-mans-fuel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;needs to be filtered&lt;/a&gt; with a 5 micron filter.  After you process the oil into biodiesel, make sure you have it stored safely.  Unlike gasoline, diesel doesn't ignite without high pressures.  However, your area may have storage regulations to be considered (for example, I seem to remember that California limited storage to 55 gallons or less of fuel, without a special license).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;dagger; Large, chain restaurants will have rigid oil disposal contracts with rendering companies, so don't waste your time with them.

The boundaries are a &lt;em&gt;subjective choice&lt;/em&gt;, but you will want to be aware that different manufacturers may give you data with different boundaries and you will need to account for that when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Side note: energy is just one of many environmental performance indicators that may be included in an LCA.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The different industries are in the process of developing &lt;strong&gt;Product Category Rules&lt;/strong&gt; (PCR) which set guidelines for how to measure environmental impacts appropriate to their product. These rules are developed by consensus of industry experts in accordance with several ISO standards (14025, 14040-14043, 21930, etc.) and allow for fair comparisons between the products of different manufacturers. The PCRs are just being developed, so they can be hard to find. Here is an example for &lt;a href=&quot;http://pcr-library.edf.org.tw/data/taiwan/201212_EPD-PCR_%20Electronics%20_%20LED%20Luminaries%20For%20General%20Lighting.pdf&quot;&gt;LED lighting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the PCR has been developed, manufacturers can produce &lt;strong&gt;Environmental Product Declarations&lt;/strong&gt; (EPD) for their products, which are then verified by a third party (an organization like UL, appropriate to the product). The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrel.gov/lci/&quot;&gt;US Lifecycle Inventory Database&lt;/a&gt; is one organization that is trying to compile the EPDs from various manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all a long way of saying that your question may be even more complex than you realize.

As a battery is being drained the voltage drops down. In some batteries the voltage goes down very slowly during most of the discharge cycle but rapidly at the end (NiMH accumulators) in some the voltage goes down more evenly (Alkaline batteries). For illustration below are discharge curves (showing the voltage going down) from this page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philohome.com/batteries/bat.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Batteries and Battery packs&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/M2j2O.gif&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;current&lt;/strong&gt; - When a device needs more power it takes higher current. (or needs higher voltage -&gt; batteries connected in series) As the current rises the voltage drops down. See the internal resistance which contributes to the voltage drop below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;internal resistance&lt;/strong&gt; - Higher internal resistance causes larger voltage drop and also higher energy loss. (The energy transforms to heat inside the battery.) The internal resistance is higher in older and lower-quality batteries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conditions to reuse partially discharged battery&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this information you can see that if some of the following conditions are fulfilled you will be able to use the battery in a second device after it is unusable in the first:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1st device drains relatively high current&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1st device needs relatively high voltage from a single cell to operate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;battery has an even discharge curve&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;battery has high internal resistance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2nd device drains lower current&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2nd device needs lower voltage from a single cell to operate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So lower the current and voltage the second device needs - more power it can utilize from a partially discharged battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Examples of suitable devices which can be powered by partially discharged batteries&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that the following device types can satisfy the conditions stated above:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;clocks (both digital and electro-mechanical)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;digital thermometers, pocket digital games with simple graphics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;digital thermostats&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;remote commands, wireless keyboards, mouses&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pocket radios and digital audio players&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bicycle led lights, led head lamps, cyclocomputers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Other solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other possibility is to build a power source which will need relatively low voltage per single battery cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact some modern devices use more and more efficient power management circuits. The devices need low voltage inside which also helps low power consumption. The low voltage is produced by a power efficient switching voltage stabilizer/regulator which can possibly operate with wide range of input voltage so that batteries can be efficiently discharged to a low voltage and more energy can be retrieved from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly possible to construct a power source which will generate stabilized electrical power from a possibly large number of half-discharged batteries by using a switching regulator. I have never seen a mention of such a device. The procedure of replacing the batteries would be probably annoying. Because of dependability of such a power source (varying run-time) I would imagine its use for example for charging of other batteries e.g. in cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because partially discharged batteries have various properties they cannot be effectively used connected in series. On fully discharged cells connected into the circuit there would be unnecessary losses and they can even leak the electrolyte. For this reason there should be a separate regulator for each cell which makes the device more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion it is practical to use half-discharged batteries in a low power demanding devices mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;More for sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding sustainability it is best to avoid using batteries as much as possible.

The decrease is 0.3V or 0.6V.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the last stadium I switch both switches on&lt;/strong&gt; and 1V is reached by two 0.5V batteries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When I want to &lt;strong&gt;deplete the batteries to 0V, I replace one of the almost empty (0.5V) batteries with a half-depleted one (1V)&lt;/strong&gt; and run them until the death of the weaker one. This is in fact the most common situation because once you have not equally drained batteries, one of them is going to die earlier and will be replaced.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first I started with resistors, not diodes, but their voltage drop depends on the current - when the current fluctuates, the voltage drop changes too. This is not wanted, diodes provide a constant voltage drop to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tweaks: more batteries can be grouped to reach a better use of used batteries.

If there is a local user of them it would be worth asking whether you can get some from them as bulk purchase prices tend to be lower. Or look for any kind of large plastic container - I bought a number of 200 litre plastic barrels for ~$AUS15 each (under 10 euro) from a local recycle/reuse merchant (he dealt only in second hand food grade bulk containers). We used them as rainwater barrels, but they would also work as worm farms. Also, the plastic bread trays used to deliver bread are a good source of gratings for the worm farms (ask the local bread factory as they will have a supply of broken ones).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That design would easily scale up to a 220 litre wheely bin, and the advantage is that you can move them easily. You can assemble them and get them started somewhere easy for you, and if people are not using one, or one fails (and gets stinky), you can just wheel it down to the garage and deal with it there. You could also easily swap the bins between high-use and low-use groups of people so they all get about the same level of input.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is that by having mobile worm farms that are fairly easy to build you can start with one or two and build more as you need them. That also avoids having to buy worms (fed properly worms will double in number every month or so, and any excess will escape much to the delight of any chickens in the area)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: if you want something that is cheap but takes little to no construction expertise you could use polystyrene vegetable boxes (you can see one between the bins in the top left photo above). At least in Australia vegetables that need to be chilled are often transported in polystyrene boxes that are about 25cm wide, 30cm high and 70cm long. And they have a fitting lid, also polystyrene. Those are often available cheap or free from fruit and vege shops. We used those as worm farms for a while since they're cheap and easy. Just poke some holes in the bottom, add worms and food, cover the top with a layer of newspaper and put the lid on. Cut another one down so it's about 10cm high and put that underneath to catch the liquid that runs through the holes you made. You can stack these two high. The problem is that they're somewhat messy to deal with since they don't have handles and you have to life them up to extract the liquid (take the lid off, put it upside down on a few sheets of paper next to the worm farm, lift the top box off and put it on the lid, put the bottom box on top of that, then use a cup to bail out the liquid).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="659" LastEditorUserId="659" LastEditDate="2013-10-30T20:29:09.517" LastActivityDate="2013-10-30T20:29:09.517" CommentCount="4" />

It is further subjective on how much value is assigned to each category and if, for example, the clearance of rain forest is rated to be more harmful than the clearance of temperate forest (as &lt;em&gt;THelper&lt;/em&gt; mentioned).

His thesis is &lt;a href=&quot;https://kobra.bibliothek.uni-kassel.de/handle/urn%3anbn%3ade%3ahebis:34-200604119596&quot;&gt;freely available in German&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theiet.org/resources/books/renewable/scenarios.cfm&quot;&gt;English translation can be bought from the IET&lt;/a&gt;. His other papers (some in English, some in German) are &lt;a href=&quot;http://transnational-renewables.org/Gregor_Czisch/veroeffentlichungen.html&quot;&gt;freely downloadable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model found that increasing the area across which solar and wind were captured, and transmitting that power anywhere across the enlarged area, was one of the cheapest ways to incorporate very high levels of wind and solar into the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the concept that he and Gregor Giebel developed, of an international supergrid, has really caught on, and the number and size of international electricity connectors (aka interconnectors) has been growing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of Czisch's scenarios, and most subsequent 100% renewables scenarios developed by others, combine this supergrid with storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Energy Storage&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people immediately think of grid storage as being something where you put electricity in, and that later get almost all that electricity out again. But that round-trip electricity storage is only one type of useful storage for the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storage balances the grid by time-shifting &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to match supply and demand moment-by-moment. Having storage &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in the chain between the capture of the primary energy, and delivery of the energy service demand, achieves that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Storing energy somewhere in the electricity supply chain&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the electricity supply chain. I'll tag each of the links in the chain with a number, for reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Capture of primary energy&lt;br&gt;&#xA;   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;darr;  &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Primary electricity generation&lt;br&gt;&#xA;   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;darr;  &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Electricity delivery&lt;br&gt;&#xA;   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;darr;  &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Consumption of the energy service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can introduce storage at any of those links, to balance the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomass in a silo sits at link &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. The primary energy has been captured from the sun, locked up in carbohydrates in the plant matter, and that plant matter is then stored until electricity is needed, at which point it is burnt, and the heat is used to drive a turbine. Similarly, water in the upper reservoir of a storage hydro plant is also energy storage at link &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round-trip electricity storage, such as pumped hydro storage, chemical batteries, flywheels, and ultra-capacitors, sits at link &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the electricity has been delivered, it has to be consumed. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the end-use of the energy has to happen at that time. It does in some cases - for example if you want light, it's no easier to store pure light than it is to store pure electricity, so electricity consumption and use of light happen pretty much simultaneously. However, most of our domestic energy consumption is for space heating, space cooling, water heating, and water cooling. And it's very easy to store warmth or coolth, for use later. So it's pretty easy to build lots of storage at link &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;. Particulary when heating (and maybe cooling) services are provided by shared infrastructure, such as a district heating scheme, where mutli-fuel sources including electricity can be harnessed, and storage of hot water and cold water can be centralised, reaping huge economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Some different types of energy storage for the grid, illustrated:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/gqb2v.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CzoDm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeoV4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aGordon_Dam.jpg&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aPimlico_accumulator_tower_1.jpg&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aPellets_hand.jpg&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastActivityDate="2013-11-03T10:25:45.870" />

As an example of the latter, consider a grid powered by both wind and solar sources: these are likely to provide peak output at different times, since sunny and windy conditions do not tend to go together[1], and will thus suffer less from the variability of each than a grid powered entirely from either one. Wind and wave are also an interesting combination, since one tends to precede the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage:&lt;/strong&gt; See EnergyNumbers' excellent answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand response:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you care which exact times your fridge is on, or do you just care that it stays below a given temperature?

When you put a load of washing in the washing machine to run overnight, do you care whether it runs immediately, or would you be content for it to run &quot;sometime during the night&quot;, with a &quot;finished by&quot; time? There could be a lower electricity cost associated with the latter options, and the network operator could activate your fridge/car/washing machine when there is spare capacity in the system.

Such capacity that can be rapidly powered up or down is known as &quot;dispatchable&quot; generation. &#xA;It is worth noting that this is not a new concept associated with renewables; already, there must be sufficient standby capacity available to cope with the largest single generator on the grid unexpectedly disconnecting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question specifically asks about cost-effectiveness, and that is difficult to comment on.

The plastic is sorted&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sorting and grouping plastic materials according to resin type is an important first step in the recycling process because contamination can render a batch of material un-reusable. The most frequently recycled resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), must be carefully separated from one another in order to enable further processing. Contaminants within each type of plastic must also be removed from the base resin to ensure stock purity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2. The plastic is cut into flakes and foreign objects are removed&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Plastic materials usually need to be cut into smaller sizes in order to allow further processing and to provide easier packaging, transportation, and distribution of recycled stock.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After the plastic has been cut into smaller pieces, or “flakes,” the stock usually needs to be washed in order to remove lingering dirt or attachments. Paper, glue, sand, and grit are some of the common elements targeted in the washing process, which can be accomplished using water baths, friction washers, or a washing line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To reduce the potential for stock contamination most recycled plastic undergoes separation treatments, which work to remove any attachments or non-reusable materials that may be present in a batch of flakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;3. The plastic is formed into pellets to be sold&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Pelletizing reclaimed plastic is the final step in most recycling processes. Converting post-consumer plastic into pellets allows for easier distribution and remanufacturing, and ultimately benefits the speed and effectiveness of reintroducing recycled plastic into industrial manufacturing. After sorting, drawing, separating, and drying the reclaimed material, the flake stock is ready to be extruded into pellets.  Once the reclaimed plastic has been pelletized, it is ready for distribution and remanufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could (possibly) do this yourself, although it seems like a better idea to buy the plastic pellets - if you have something to do with them, that is.

Ruth Stout apparently pulls her mulch aside, throws chunks of potatoes on top of the ground and then pulls the mulch back over them to cover them.  Later, as the vines grow, she adds more.  So it can work.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can grow root crops in a no till garden as well - just be sure that you start out with shorter varieties until the soil begins to loosen up enough for the longer root crops to dig themselves in properly.  For example, depending on how your soil is to begin with, you could grow &quot;thumbelina&quot; or short fingerling type carrots the first couple of years instead of the foot-long type. Things like turnips and round beets should do okay in a new no-till garden as well, just be sure to draw the mulch up around the top of their bulbs so they don't turn green.

Much of the heat you generate will escape with the air which escapes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are in a space where there is little likelihood of hot air escaping, but where the walls are thin and poorly insulated, then a fan heater might be better. While some of the heat from the radiative heater will strike you and heat you directly, the energy which hits the walls will be divided between radiating back into the room and escaping through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a well insulated room with little escape of air, there would be negligible differences between the different methods other than perceptual ones. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Safety&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is usually recommended that radiative and fan heaters are not left running when unattended. Even when an oil filled radiator is rated for unattended operation, care should be taken, as with any heating device, that nothing flammable is left close to or in contact with the heater.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Care should also be taken with these heaters when used in a room where people are sleeping. If there is &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; chance that they could be knocked over, or bedding/clothes could fall on them and pose fire risk, do not use the heater.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in kitchens and bathrooms, only use appliances rated for use in those rooms. Moisture in the air could cause a heater not rated for those environments to fail, posing an additional fire risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Personal experience&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From personal experience, I always &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; warmer in front of a radiative heater, and they certainly produce less noise pollution than fan heaters, so are more pleasant to be around. Both are more controllable than oil frilled radiators, so you get heat out of them sooner after you need it and waste little heat when you no longer need it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find infra-red heaters particularly useful in bathrooms. Heaters like the following are (or were) common in UK bathrooms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tlc-direct.co.uk/Products/DXIRX120N.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tlc-direct.co.uk/Images/Products/size_3/DXIRX120N.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Dimplex IRX120N - 1200 Watt Infra Red Wall Heater - Image used without permission, but with attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way to use a heater like this is on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't normally heat my bathroom, but I turn on my bathroom IR wall heater before I get in the shower so it is up to full heat by the time I get out of the shower. The infra-red heat keeps me nice and warm in those those crucial moments between stopping the hot water flow and towelling off the rapidly cooling water. I then turn off the heater as I leave the bathroom, having wasted little electricity unnecessarily heating it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never understood why people replace IR wall heaters in bathrooms with fan heaters. I find that they can never warm up the air in the bathroom enough during the time you are showering that you don't feel cold during the towelling.

If you don't ensure that that moisture is taken away, you risk condensation, mould, and consequential damage to property and health. So think about your ventilation strategy. Ventilation in infrequent bursts - i.e. just opening windows or doors once a day to exchange the air completely - may not be enough.

Molds are useful and help decomposing the bin contents. However, you do have to regulate the moisture level of your worm bin! If a worm bin is too wet it will start to smell and the worms won't like a lot of water. If a bin becomes excessively wet your worms may even die and/or drown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most worm bins have a draining system for draining superfluous liquid. It is not very hard to add such a system to your bin. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option1:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a raised floor to the inside of your bin, for example made from the bottom of a similar-sized container. You'll have to make some small holls in the second floor so the water can seep through. If you then add a small tap at the outside bottom, you can drain the water every now and then. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option2:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternatively you can make some small holls directly in the floor of your bin. It's best to place the bin in a raised position in another open container so you can catch any fluid when it drips out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the first option you still have a closed system, so there is no worry of smell. A drawback is that it may not be easy to add a tap that doesn't leak around the edges.&#xA;The second option is easier to achieve, but any water dripping out is right in the open, so there may be a smell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from adding a drainage system, there is another alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option3:&lt;/strong&gt; Carefully regulate the moisture content of your bin. This may not be easy, but it is doable. You'll probably have to dry wet materials like fruit peelings a bit before you can add them to your bin. If the bin still is becoming too wet, add dry cardboard or paper to get back to the correct moisture level.

Thousands of scientists and other experts contribute (on a voluntary basis, without payment from the IPCC) to writing and reviewing reports, which are reviewed by representatives from all the governments, with a Summary for Policymakers being subject to line-by-line approval by all participating governments. Typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/044.htm&quot;&gt;their report linked above&lt;/a&gt; (which you must read completely if you're serious about this subject) they summarize the increase of greenhouse gases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For about a thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, the&#xA;  amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remained relatively&#xA;  constant. Since then, the concentration of various greenhouse gases&#xA;  has increased. The amount of carbon dioxide, for example, has&#xA;  increased by more than 30% since pre-industrial times and is still&#xA;  increasing at an unprecedented rate of on average 0.4% per year,&#xA;  mainly due to the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. We&#xA;  know that this increase is anthropogenic because the changing isotopic&#xA;  composition of the atmospheric CO2 betrays the fossil origin of the&#xA;  increase. The concentration of other natural radiatively active&#xA;  atmospheric components, such as methane and nitrous oxide, is&#xA;  increasing as well due to agricultural, industrial and other&#xA;  activities. The concentration of the nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and&#xA;  of carbon monoxide (CO) are also increasing. Although these gases are&#xA;  not greenhouse gases, they play a role in the atmospheric chemistry&#xA;  and have led to an increase in tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas,&#xA;  by 40% since pre-industrial times (Chapter 4).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that over decades we can measure our human based output and then measure the increase in the sinks vs atmosphere.  Then we can estimate how much contributes to the overall atmosphere.  Since sinks can sources all have different carbon time cycles you can not say &quot;this year x% of the ppm increase is anthropomorphic&quot;.  You can say that over the decades we see that x% produced leads to y% absorbed and a corresponding z% increase in the atmosphere.  But as the sinks saturate and temperatures change they change too, so it is not a rule but a dynamic system which we try to model to understand it.  We model these complex systems &lt;strong&gt;so that we can answer the types of abstract questions you are asking&lt;/strong&gt;.  &quot;What does this measured ppm increase mean exactly?  What are the possible contributors?  What happens yearly?  What happens monthly?  Why is the average temperature increasing by x?  What happens if XX process doubles, or halves?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Given that CO2 has such a major role in the natural greenhouse effect,&#xA;  it makes intuitive sense that changes in its concentration because of&#xA;  human activities might significantly enhance the greenhouse effect.&#xA;  However, calculating the impact of a change in CO2 is very different&#xA;  from calculating the current role with respect to water vapor and&#xA;  clouds. This is because both of these other substances depend on&#xA;  temperatures and atmospheric circulation in ways that CO2 does not.&#xA;  For instance, as temperature rises, the maximum sustainable water&#xA;  vapor concentration increases by about 7% per degree Celsius. Clouds&#xA;  too depend on temperature, pressure, convection and water vapor&#xA;  amounts. So a change in CO2 that affects the greenhouse effect will&#xA;  also change the water vapor and the clouds. Thus, the total greenhouse&#xA;  effect after a change in CO2 needs to account for the consequent&#xA;  changes in the other components as well. If, for instance, CO2&#xA;  concentrations are doubled, then the absorption would increase by 4&#xA;  W/m2, but once the water vapor and clouds react, the absorption&#xA;  increases by almost 20 W/m2 — demonstrating that (in the GISS climate&#xA;  model, at least) the &quot;feedbacks&quot; are amplifying the effects of the&#xA;  initial radiative forcing from CO2 alone. Past climate data suggests&#xA;  that this is what happens in the real world as well.

This means that if the bin is closed, there is no chance of any odors coming out. However there probably is a soury smell if the bin is opened, for example when you add more food scraps or when you add the compost at the end of stage one. Usually the smell is nothing too bad, but if you dislike it you may want to open it outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see no reason why the Smartbin cannot be used by a family of two, or by a single person for that matter. You just gather all your food scraps until the bin is full (or half full is you leave space for adding compost later). If you don't generate much food waste just make sure you use a small bin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to DIY, you'll have to buy your own airtight bins.

For example, in the UK there is the &quot;Green Deal&quot;. These schemes will vary in their usefulness versus the amount of bureaucracy involved, but are worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also don't mention too much about the finance arrangements around your tenancy; from what you've written, it sounds as though your landlady lives in the house with you. It's not clear whether she pays the energy bills or whether they are shared? Obviously in the first case she has a better financial incentive to improve matters, but either way you are far better off than the more usual case where the landlord is not present, and has no incentive to reduce the tenant's energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not familiar with what the climate is like in Maryland, but I'll assume temperate. You mention that you use a little air conditioning - I probably won't cover that much as I know little about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measures that you and she could consider fall broadly into two categories: Firstly in reducing the home's energy use, and secondly in making sure that that energy that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; required is delivered in the most efficient and/or cost-effective way that it can. Some of these things will not be applicable to your home, and some may already have been done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Reducing demand&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Light&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is potentially a quick, cheap and easy area for improvement. Except for specialist types such as those in ovens, you should not be using any plain tungsten incandescent light bulbs. For general lighting, look to compact fluorescent (CFL). For spotlighting, for low output requirements, or for areas that are switched on and off very frequently, look at LED. If you really cannot stand to move away from an incandescent glow, or you need a light to be dimmable, use tungsten halogen lamps - preferably the low voltage variety, which are substantially more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all of these technology types, it is worth paying for a reputable brand (e.g. Osram, Philips, GE). CFLs and LEDs have gained a bad reputation with some people due to cheap versions failing early. The same applies to the transformers in low voltage halogen fixtures. If moving to LEDs, buy one first to check that you are happy with the colour - the quality of &quot;white&quot; varies widely. If moving to CFL or LED, don't trust the manufacturers' claims on &quot;equivalent wattage&quot; - instead, look at the number of lumens that they produce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Heat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is slightly less cheap and easy, but some measures are still straightforward. If you are in even a moderately cold climate, heat will probably account for about half of your domestic energy use, so reducing this is potentially a big saving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that there is a good amount (up to 200-300mm) of modern loft insulation in your roof. This is quick and cheap to install, and without it all of your heat rises straight out the top of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get draughts under doors, etc., fit draught excluders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure windows are double (or even triple) glazed. Moving from single to double glazing in particular is a major improvement in insulation. Potentially expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall insulation depends very much upon the walls. If you have cavity walls, get them filled with insulating foam. If you have solid walls, there are insulating panels that you can fit on the inside, but this does reduce the size of your rooms. As an alternative, take inspiration from medieval times and put wool hangings on the inside of the walls. Make sure there are flame-retardant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Other measures&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When replacing electrical appliances in the future, get ones with high energy efficiency ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn down the heating and/or air con in rooms that are not being used for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to instil a culture of people turning things off when they leave the room - especially lights, but also avoid leaving televisions playing to nobody, and so forth. Depending on what people are like to start with, this can potentially be a huge saving, and it has no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cultural change: If people can be happy wearing a jumper, rather than expecting to be comfortable year-round in a thin sleeveless top, you can make major savings in heating. Get thicker duvets and turn down bedroom temperatures. The same is true with air con, of course, although there's perhaps a limited extent to which you can expect folk to wear less... ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Improving energy delivery&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Renewable sources&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should consider,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Photovoltaics (i.e. solar panels that produce electricity)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Solar thermal water heating (pipes on the roof that provide &quot;free&quot; hot water)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibly&lt;/em&gt; a small wind turbine (although very small household ones are perhaps of dubious worth)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The value of all of these will depend on many factors, including the design and orientation of the building, where in the world you are, the wind speeds that you experience, etc. Each might be the subject of a good question here in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economics of some of these may be strongly influenced by any subsidies or other measures that your government offers to encourage them - for example, the feed-in tariff scheme in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Heating&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With insulation, you have already minimised the amount of heat that the property needs. Now you can think about reducing the cost of providing the heat that is needed. Much will depend on the design of the house, and on the relative costs and availability of fuel where you are located. The costs will also depend greatly on the system that is installed at present. The most energy-efficient approach is likely to be a heat pump, preferably a ground-source one if possible. The most &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; approach may be a heat pump, or it may be a modern, efficient gas-fired central heating system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an overview; there are a number of topics in there that might make good SE questions in their own right.

Put some insulation on top of the sensor extending a few inches along pipe and around it (to ensure the sensor measures the temperature of the outside wall of the pipe, which will essentially be the same as the water). Let the tap run and measure also the temperature of water coming out of tap until it stabilizes. Write down also the temperature inside the tank as indicated by the sensor you already have set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now write down the time and turn resistance on for one hour or whatever time it takes to rise the temperature of the water inside the tank by about 15 degrees celsius or so. Make sure nobody opens any tap, including cold water ones during the heating period. Then shut the resistance off and open the hot water tap. Note the highest temperature (at first the water will come out cold-warm as the pipes warm up). Then the water gradually gets hotter until a maximum and will start to drop again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now repeat the process on a sunny day when the sun is at the highest point but this time make sure the resistance is always off. Wait the same time it took the resistance to rise the temperature and note the temperature inside the tank and the highest temperature coming out of the hot water tap (the incoming cold water temperature should have been the same in both cases but if it is not because somehow the cold water pipe that brings water to the tank somehow picks up daytime heat and the incominc temperature is higher than after sunset, do not worry, you just have to make a different calculation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now there are two ways to estimate the power output of the solar unit and you should use both because they should match.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Divide the time it took the solar unit to increase the temperature 15 degrees into the time it took the resistance. The result you multiply it by 2000, the result will be the wattage of the solar panel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other calculation to verify is a bit more elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The idea is to calculate the energy required to heat whatever kg of water the tank holds from the cold water temperature to the hot water temperatur, the result you divide it by the time, first the resistance time and then by the solar system time. This calculation must be made by someone who knows how to work with mass, energy and power units to also end up with watts for the resistance and the solar system. If the resistance is in the innards of the tank, as is normally the case the second set of calculations should confirm the first.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am assuming your resistance is really putting out 2000 watts as some are made of two elements and one could fail or be inactive. You can verify this with an ammeter, multiplying amps times volts (115-120 or 230-240 depending on how the resistance is wired up)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should now have a fairly good idea of the peak wattage your solar panel puts out on the type of sunny day you took the measurements. On less sunny days and off noon, power will be less. If you want to know how much less you will have to repeat the measurements for the panel. No need to measure again for the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to measure the average power of the solar panel it gets a bit more complicated but on a sunny day it will be the result of taking how many degrees the tank water temperature increases each sunny hour until noon. After noon the power will mirror before noon. Even if the temperature starts to drop later in the afternoon it does not mean the panel is not putting out power. It does, otherwise the cooling would be faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not done these calculations on my panel but your question got me thinking and I will now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="959" LastEditorUserId="99" LastEditDate="2013-12-09T08:50:40.207" LastActivityDate="2013-12-09T08:50:40.207" CommentCount="1" />

We already have all the technology we need for 100% renewable electricity grids combined with the electrification of urban transport and heating. And for most countries, that's more economic than any alternative, once the externalities (pollution, liability cover) are priced in. What's missing is political will and vision. And that is, in part, driven by ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Industrial incumbents&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like most countries, Ireland has industrial incumbents with a lot of fixed assets (with sunk costs) that are dedicatd to highly-polluting ways to do things. So they carry a lot of economic weight, and consequentially political weight too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;One much larger neighbour&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most countries, large-capacity interconnectors to several neighbours provide the best option for balancing a grid with a high (&gt;50%) proportion of exogenously-variable renewables such as wind, wave, tidal and solar: and Ireland's potential renewables are mostly of that kind, with relatively little scope for geothermal or storage hydro.  However, Ireland, being on the continental periphery, has just one close neighbour, that is much larger than it. And that means the bigger the interconnectors, the more that prices on the all-Ireland grid would get driven largely by what's happening on the British grid, which makes it politically and economically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Balancing the grid at the scale of quarter-cycle to seconds&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exogenously-variable renewables such as wind don't necessarily bring much inertia to the grid, unlike thermal plant (and in particular coal). So the sort of balancing of supply and demand (aka balancing) that happens very easily on a grid with lots of fossil plant, at the scale of quarter-cycle (5ms on a 50Hz grid) to a few seconds, needs more planning and realigned incentives on a wind-rich grid. Technically, it's a solved problem - Quebec's grid, and others, have incentivised the innovation of within-turbine grid-balancing services at these time scales. What's missing, is a successful model for economic incentivisation to ensure the best balance of the maximisation of generated electricity, with sufficient balancing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Rural, water and air transport&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rural, water and air transport remain challenges for most countries. Hydrocarbons provide a very high ratio of energy per unit mass, and per unit volume, and those are incredibly valuable for motorised transport. There are a bunch of options: biogenic hydrocarbons, synthetic hydrocarbons, hydrogen, some putative new chemical battery - but as yet there are no clear winners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Things which had looked like challenges, but now have known solutions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Size of the available renewable resource&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It used to be thought that that might be an issue, and some people got worried because energy per unit land area seemed to be low. That turned out to be a non-issue, once people did the maths. The island of Ireland's total energy consumption (electricity, heat, transport, etc) is about 21.5GW (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellandwarm.ie/Publications/Statistics_Publications/EPSSU_Publications/Energy_in_Ireland_Key_Statistics/Energy_in_Ireland_Key_Statistics_2012.pdf&quot;&gt;15GW&lt;/a&gt; for Eire, 6.5GW for Northern Ireland). Its land area is 84&amp;nbsp;421&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and its sea area is well over 400&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning that even at the 2W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that non-optimised onshore wind gives, sufficiency of the available resource is not a challenge: only a tiny fraction of Ireland's land and waters would need renewables, to meet all current energy consumption, and that's without any energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(I've no intention of causing conflict by considering the island as a whole: the grids of Eire and Northern Ireland are combined, and the same wind, sun, tides and waves reach both parts of the island. So it's just technically easier to analyse the island of Ireland as one whole entity)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Balancing the grid at the scale of minutes to days&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this used to be a problem, but now we're spoilt for solutions. Electricity interconnectors to neighbours do raise challenges of political economics, but in terms of capital investment they're very affordable, and provide a technical solution for most of the problem. The rest can be taken care of through sustainable biomass and power-to-gas. There has been a project to lobby for extensive pumped hydro storage in Eire, but the economics don't currently look favourable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Forecastability of the weather&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no countries immediately to the west or south-west of Ireland; and that's the direction that most of the weather comes in from. That means that Ireland has fewer opportunities than most of the rest of Europe to gather free weather information for 4-hour and 24-hour ahead forecasts. However, with the growing use of weather buoys, weather masts and floating LiDAR, complemented by satellite data, this is a solved problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastActivityDate="2013-12-12T08:02:26.313" CommentCount="1" />

Di-Syston&#xA; 2. Lindane&#xA; 3. Dimethoate&#xA; 4. Asana&#xA; 5. Lorsban&#xA; 6. Savey&#xA; 7. Morestan&#xA; 8. Talstar&#xA; 9. Thiodan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Herbicides&#xA; 1. Roundup&#xA; 2. Simazine&#xA; 3. Goal&#xA; 4. Stinger&#xA; 5. Garlon&#xA; 6. Crossbow&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These help greatly to increase the shelf lives of the trees but we have some idea as the the kind of effects these chemicals can have especially after long-term exposure. It can be argued that the kind of exposure we undergo from the short period of owning the these trees would not necessarily be cause for concern. However, it is my guess and many other people's that anything designed to kill bugs and weeds is usually toxic to humans. Therefore there ought to be some concern there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can always ask who you purchase the tree from about their chemical usage and this sort of information should be readily available to the customer. If you want to get trees that are not exposed to such chemicals, you can purchase certified organic trees. Organic farming reduces and in most cases eliminates the use of such chemicals. These methods are a bit more expensive but it helps in reducing or limiting our exposure to chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="315" LastActivityDate="2013-12-23T13:37:28.107" />

I had EIGHT 220 watt PV panels left from an installation (at my office), and I wanted to use them to heat water (much more efficient use than sitting in my shed for a year! Right? ). 220 x 8 is only 1760 watts. I found a new &quot;Brand X&quot; 50 Gal Electric HW heater locally for $315 (no delivery - had to fetch it - UGH!).  Was 1760 watts enough to heat my tank to 130 or preferably even higher (say 170F), in 4 hours of full sun???  That was the MAIN question - and would the thermostats work right? (they ARE mechanical and heat is the key, so it should be OK).&lt;br/&gt; I get a little over 4 hours of sun in winter where I wanted to put the panels - almost 5 hrs in summer (flat on porch roof - can't be seen except by Google Sats or planes from the air).  They say that normal tank recovery to 140F was 1.25 hours at 3300 watts from 68 degree cold water (it seems too long a time - I didn't do the calculations, but I will - eventually) - takes longer for colder water - luckily I'm in Fla. Cold water temp is fairly stable 65 to 70.  A 50 gal tank will last my small family (3 of us) 3 to 4 days (I HOPE), but only if I set it 165 or 170 and use a cold water mixer also called an &quot;infuser&quot; I think (it mixes cold with hot on the output and keeps water from being dangerously hot in the shower, or for kids at a faucet, etc.).  The infuser is a trick I learned some years ago with a smaller 30 gal tank from my brother-in-law (thanks RICK!).&lt;br/&gt; I had just enough 8 AWG wire - 10 AWG would have worked, but I had 8 so that's OK - another volt or two not dropped on the way in, I guess. After 7 days and 4 problems (all not directly related to the project itself, but a PAIN nonetheless), I got it installed (the tank was last). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;And the answer turns out to be YES - and NO. &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Yes it works. But on the NO side,&lt;br/&gt; The CONS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;1) I am only getting 221 VDC at 7.4 amps - should be 230 or so under full sun (29VDC at max output x 8 panels in series). What happened to my 10 volts or so? Not that big a deal, I suppose. The coils are so low a resistance they are MAXING out the panels as I thought they would. Top coil comes on first, and an hour and a half to 2 hours later, CLICK - the lower one is on.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;2) It does not always get hot enough - not even a full hour of clouds half-way through the heating cycle messes it up (pretty badly) - lots of warm water! (&lt;b&gt;Note to self: Wife says &quot;warm&quot; is 100% FAILURE.&lt;/b&gt; Ooooo-Kay. HOT it must become... somehow ).&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;3) I only get two days of hot water after 1 full day of sun (4.5 to 5 hours), instead of a minimum of 3 as I want (and need), maybe because I only have it set to 135-140.  170 was WAY too hot since the infuser does not come on right away and with the first burst of hot water you can get scalded pretty badly if you are not careful (thankfully - he have no small kids). I need a faster acting infuser - this one is some type of bi-metal switch that mounts around/against the hot-out-bound copper pipe right out of the tank and it reacts too slow (looks like a WW-II or maybe a WW-I surplus thing). I need an Electric sensor/switch of some kind, or maybe adjustable-pressure based unit of some kind. I am searching for one. Something MUCH faster, anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;4) If they were not spare panels - cost might be be prohibitive.  We paid 68 cents/watt (per whole palette of 25) - 220 x 8 was $1760 plus $315+tax for the 50 gal &quot;el-cheapo&quot;  electric tank, $45 for small breaker box and DC beaker for PV panel supply). No mounting costs - they just lay flat on the porch roof with one bolt as a tie down (protected from wind, great drainage, slightly tilted up toward west - better for the afternoon sun, too).&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;5) Payback right now is 3.5 years + possible alimony for life if not made HOT-HOT-HOT (about 20% to 22% of electric bill - $550/year). Too long to suit me (but not too bad, really - panels will surely outlast the new tank unless we get a bad hail storm (very rare down here, BUT...I still worry about it). I PRAY a new infuser and going up to 170F will give me the extra day I want (and make my WIFE happy... it HAS to... no choice in the matter.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;NOW for the PROS:&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;1) Super EASY to install. Bozo the clown could do it, except for &quot;sweating&quot; the copper pipes for the new tank (torch soldering). Adding them to an existing tank installation would be a NO brain-er.&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;2) No (leaky) pipes to run - no heat exchanger, no &quot;Fred &amp;amp; Ethel Glycol&quot; (old fluid mechanics joke) or other fluid heat carrying medium, or not pushing the cold up, and hot water down from a direct concentrator system. &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;3) GREAT use for spare PV panels. Actually a good deal if you can get panels for less than about 65 cents/watt any time (without having to buy a train load of them).&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;4) We have always had AT LEAST a warm shower in 6 months of use - Never cold - (I do warm, OK - &lt;b&gt;My WIFE does NOT - NEVER WILL - EVER - even if H**L freezes over... EVER, NEVER EVER. PERIOD OVER AND OUT! Got it?? I got it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;i&gt;And did I mention mt WIFE does not like WARM showers. NEVER, EVER? ok? ok.).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;5) Also, make sure to check with your wife BEFORE you do this. To be on the safe side - that is. ALWAYS check with your wife!  OK? GOT THAT? ok. Me too. I GOT that. And I hear about it often... even 6 months later... once a week at least... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; YIKES! I need that NEW, FASTER infuser - (anyone have one?). &lt;b&gt;I wonder who gets the dog in a divorce?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  I KNOW for a fact that I will get the NEW hot water heating system. &lt;b&gt;And I may even have to wear it out of the house - around my neck someday.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &#xA;If you try it out, GOOD LUCK!&lt;br/&gt; &#xA;&lt;b&gt;THE FINAL ANALYSIS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;SUN POWER! PV direct for hot water - It works!!!&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;i&gt;(If warm showers once a month, or so, are OK for you --&lt;b&gt;AND YOUR WIFE...&lt;/b&gt; that is).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;One other thing - if you try this, for health reasons, make sure your tank switches elements and both the top and bottom get fully heated a minimum of every 96 hours. If you have a 3 to 4 day period of clouds, let the tank get up to full temp before you use it again (make sure both elements come on  - get out the Volt meter). I really don't have to worry about this since 4 days of warm water will put me in the hospital where they will be removing shards of glass from all over my body and aluminum solar panel frame parts from various wounds inflicted from flying PV panels...  HOT IS GOOD! WARM IS BAD.  In my future... I can see a 240 Volt 3 pole double throw relay/switch lifting all DC and applying AC after 2 days of clouds...  I'm physic like that. It's a sort of sixth sense - a survival instinct in all of us from thousands of years of marriage evolution - I'm pretty sure that's what causes it. Like a bird's Fright-n-Flight instinct.

Your question addresses exactly what the ecological footprint does not measure, and the question you link to is trying to explain that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, ecological footprint is about energy. Sunlight arrives and is used by plants (or a tiny amount is used directly by people via PV or other solar power systems), which use it to convert CO2 out of the air into more complex carbon molecules. So you can take a complicated cycle like &quot;plants plus time to coal, coal plus iron to steel becomes car&quot; and work backwards to say that the car took X amount of coal, or X amount of energy, to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As the Ecological Footprint measures the area required to produce a&#xA;  material or absorb carbon dioxide emissions, materials such as mercury&#xA;  that are not created by biological processes nor absorbed by&#xA;  biological systems do not have a defined Ecological Footprint&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use aluminium as you do, what they're saying is that aluminium as a metal does not have an ecological footprint, since nothing in the earthly environment makes aluminium. We have a finite supply of aluminium-containing rocks that we can refine the metal out of. Aluminium is not really a good example, since it's very common and not very toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's no direct ecological process that takes aluminium out of the environment. Nothing eats it, in other words. What happens is that it eventually oxidises and breaks up, forming inert compounds, in other words sand/rocks. This is perhaps most obvious with iron/steel, where parts of the world have naturally occurring iron ore right on the surface. In a lot of Western Australia they call it &quot;dirt&quot;, because the soil is 99% iron ore. It's called haematite as a rock, or rust if you see it on an iron object. That cycle is fairly obvious: take rust (haematite), heat it and remove the oxygen and you get iron. Expose iron to air and water and it breaks back down to rust. Most chemicals have more complex pathways and are often toxic through the whole pathway - dioxins and plutonium, for example, take a very long time to break down and are nasty at almost every step. And there's really no way to express that in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the ecological footprint can measure is the cost of finding aluminium ore (rocks), and turning those into useful aluminium metal objects. Or recycling them, or immobilising them to make them less poisonous. In essence, the processes are only about energy, and energy is relatively easy to express in carbon footprint terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="659" LastActivityDate="2013-12-30T10:40:56.640" CommentCount="11" />

PV system suppliers should be able to offer you simulations of the options, but bear in mind they'll be optimising their profit, rather than optimising the deal for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at why micro inverters are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The amount of power generated by a panel, given a particular level of light on it, is determined by the voltage put across the panel.

It's too early to tell, really, which has the lower whole-life cost; and the industry is moving so fast, that what we learn about inverters made 5 years ago, has to be adjusted in the light of rapidly changing prices, which changes the proportion of total system cost represented by the panels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The string inverter sits halfway betwen the two: rather than one inverter for the whole system, or one per panel, there's one per string of panels, which offers advantages of each: not really applicable to smaller (in the kilowatts) system, but important for very large ones (megawatts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="48" LastEditorUserId="48" LastEditDate="2014-01-02T08:12:07.380" LastActivityDate="2014-01-02T08:12:07.380" CommentCount="1" />

The CO2 + water H2O is converted into the biomass (carbon C + hydrogen H) + free oxigen by trees. The biomass of the plant is C+H and, since H weights nothing, it is mostly carbon C. But, the opposite process occurs when tree is cut and the plant decays. It effectively burns, C + H + oxigen O2 -&gt; CO2 + water H2O. This is because C wants to rejoin with the oxigen. CO2 is more stable than C + O2 alone. So, when you grow a deep forest, you capture some carbon from the air. Once it dies (whether naturally or you cut it will go rotten ultimately even if you do not burn it immediately), the process goes backwards and tree (C) will join the free oxigen restoring the CO2 you wanted to &quot;consume&quot;. Certainly, you can cut and conserve the grown up trees. But this is stupid: you'll need to care about the storage (waste labour, energy and other resources to mantain it) and, secondly, growing plants deplete the soil. If you do not let them composted on the place where they are grown, your soil will loose any fertility after a couple of generations. Nothing will grow on your soil after a while. Is it what you want?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idiocity of the proposed solution is immense. Consider other problems. Imagine the pristine Earth - everything is covered by green forests. The new trees in the forest consume exactly as much CO2 as there is emitted by dying ones. This is a dynamical balance - CO2 stays at constant level in the air. Now, you come with your &quot;industry&quot; and start burning (c)oil deposits from under the ground. How do you think the trees will consume your extra CO2? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could plant more trees but all the surface of the planet is green already. Furthermore, every year your &quot;factory&quot; emits more and more CO2 so that you need a constantly increasing forest lands! You do not have the place for the forests but you need more and more. Do you understand the problem? Where do you take them from? Are you going to be sustainable by replacing original plants with ones recommended here? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, it must be considered how stupid it is to consider curing the harmful effects of your economy, based on the insustainable idea of consumption (cars and private houses) to burn fossil fuels. You cannot be sustainable as long as you consume the oil at such pace. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember, the &lt;strong&gt;largest consumer of the oil&lt;/strong&gt; is not your factory, it &lt;strong&gt;is your car&lt;/strong&gt; (that you need for your house). &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/2402/476&quot;&gt;I have explained the only way our civilization can operate sustainably&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It means that you need to give up your private house with polished loan, give up your car and migrate into a large city. This would free a lot of space from the cottages for the forests. Without this measure, all talks about CO2 is deceiving ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identically, you do not want to emit the poisonous gas in the first place. It is stupid to accumulate the poisonous gas in the plants because you will contaminate the soil, you will get the contaminated plants, which you will need to store somewhere (storage will cost you additionally wasted labour, fossil fuels and more poisoned air and soils), you will get the soils depleted with minerals and rich with poisons and, moreover, you suggest that you will breeze the poisoned air yourself.

The washing machines are expensive to produce, waste space and stupid - they do not see that 95% (and 100% for those who do not eat pork) of dishes do not need neither water contamination, nor energy. You just live your dishes in the water to soak for a while. The soaked dishes are easy to rinse with water to clean up. This is the same time you place the dishes into the washing machine and extract them afterwards. But machine is worse - it is stupid and treats all you dishes as absolutely fat. It wastes tons of electricity, dishwashing liquids and contaminates the waters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asking which dishwaser to use for sustainability is a mockery over the sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt; You need clean water only to wash the dirt away at the last stage of washing. The water is not clean anymore after you do that. However, you can reuse it to soak new dishes you want to wash later. (Remember, you need to soak in order the dirt to wash away effortlessly). I often do it. Additionally, I save my time. It takes time to wash and fill some container with water to soak. But, if I combine two processes, I save the environment and time simultaneously.

In terms of both mass and volume the overwhelming majority is moved by sea. On &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejoiner.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/23/2006_01_05.jpg&quot;&gt;this graph&lt;/a&gt; just note that the air axis goes to 200, the sea axis to 18,000 - 90x as much. The bulk of my answer in the headings below compares airships to waterships. The short answer is: airships do badly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared to other aircraft&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Helicopters are crazily inefficient in energy terms and their lift capacity and range is a joke. A truck can carry more, further, faster, cheaper and more reliably.  A big helicopter can carry about 10 tonnes about 100 kilometres which is not really &quot;cargo carrying&quot; in modern terms, it's more of a specialised lifting task. Fixed wing aircraft are better on both counts, using less fuel and travelling both further and faster. A large fixed wing aircraft can carry about 300 tonnes for 15,000 kilometres, where the high end for watercraft is 120,000 tonnes for 20,000 kilometres (and the energy cost is at least a thousand times lower). An airship that can match fixed-wing aircraft lift capacity and range is useful, but bulk cargo capacity is not the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Air propellers can be more efficient than water ones &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jefflewis.net/aviation_theory-theo_prop_eff.html&quot;&gt;80%+&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychosnail.com/boatingarticles/boatpropellers&quot;&gt;~70%&lt;/a&gt; in both cases increasing with diameter and decreasing with speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the airship has to push a lot more air out of the way for a given cargo weight than a water vessel has to push water. A ship gets 1 tonne of lift for every cubic metre of water it displaces, while a helium airship gets about &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.howstuffworks.com/helium2.htm&quot;&gt;1kg per cubic metre&lt;/a&gt;. So roughly speaking an airship will have a thousand times the volume of an equivalent water ship (at this level we can assume both ships have no mass). That's enough that we can ignore air drag on the water ship and just look at water drag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At low speeds with laminar flow the drag equations are fairly simple and the dominant factor is the viscosity of the fluid. Both airship and water ship designers work quite hard to stay in this zone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity#Air&quot;&gt;Wikipedia has a list&lt;/a&gt;, with air typically about 18μPa.s and water 1000 μPa.s (50x as high). Since the airship is 1000x the volume it'll be about 10x as large in each dimension. Drag here is determined by frontal area (basically, how much fluid has to be shoved out of the way) so the airship has 100x the frontal area and 100x the drag, but air is only 1/50th the viscosity. Overall, the airship faces twice the drag of the water ship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a global scale air moves less predictably than water, and faster. Ocean currents just don't change as much as winds do. That means that airships face more vigorous weather, less predictably and hence have less ability to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also means that the airship, being both really big and really lightweight, usually can't just be tied down in a storm - the wind would tear it apart. So airships need to be docked inside a hangar. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oobject.com/category/giant-airship-hangars/&quot;&gt;really, really big hangar&lt;/a&gt;. Or they need to be semi-rigid so they can land, deflate, and park in a smaller hangar. Or just fly with the storm and come back afterwards, from wherever they got blown to. None of these is cheap, and make the airships less reliable than modern transport systems prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loading and Unloading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both types of ship require docks, and the docks have to be large and strong. But again, the difference in lift means that an airship has to be 1000x as big for the same cargo capacity. Even if the dock is just a post with a rope in the middle of a circular clearing, the airship is 10x as long so the clearing has to be 100x as large. For temporary sites, the airship can hover and winch things down. Similarly, a water ship can use a crane to unload itself. Water ships generally don't do this because they carry so much more than an airship does (a &quot;medium sized&quot; water ship might carry &lt;a href=&quot;http://maritime-connector.com/wiki/ship-sizes/&quot;&gt;100,000 tonnes of cargo&lt;/a&gt;) while a really &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/cargolifter/&quot;&gt;big airship carries 160 tonnes&lt;/a&gt; - note the absent &quot;000&quot; on the second number). That factor of 1000 conveniently means that an airship is likely to be about the same size as a water ship. So they could use the same docking areas. But with a thousand times more cargo in the water ship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="659" LastEditorUserId="659" LastEditDate="2014-01-10T09:59:41.593" LastActivityDate="2014-01-10T09:59:41.593" CommentCount="6" />

In Australia the main use of small battery-backed solar systems is for off-grid locations but people are increasingly looking at going off-grid as the cost of the grid keeps rising (mostly due to cheap air-conditioners) while the cost of PV systems drops. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're trying to reduce your total environmental impact the calculations become much more complex because you need to first decide what counts as &quot;environmental impact&quot; and how you're going to compare different sorts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/questions/2396/accounting-for-ecological-foot-print-of-non-renewable-resources&quot;&gt;see this question, for example&lt;/a&gt;), then for each option work out what the impact actually is. I'm going to assume you're just using money as your measure since the method is the same but the process is simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do the calculations you really must know not just how much electricity you use, but how much of that use can be eliminated, reduced, substituted or time-shifted. The value proposition for all of those changes when you're looking at off-grid power because of the cost of generating and storing it. You can get extremely efficient fridges, for example, but they're expensive. But off-grid the reduction in power consumption is often cheaper than generating the extra power using PV and storing it in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sort of battery technology used for houses hasn't changed significantly in the last 20 years, it's still lead-acid based.

First microorganisms need to soften the food and start decomposing it, only then will the worms eat it. Most people don't care much about how fast food is processed and simply dump it on top of the bin. This will work fine, but there are two things you can do to speed up the decomposition process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chop up the food in smaller pieces. Some people even blend the food into a puree, but personally I think that's a waste of energy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Create pockets or holes in the top layer and fill those with fresh food.

He concludes that&#xA;  government effort must be concentrated on sustainable development,&#xA;  because relatively minor improvements, for example, technology&#xA;  transfer to Third World countries, will not solve the underlying&#xA;  problem of an unsustainable economy [. . . ]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;He faults conventional economic thinking for failing to consider the&#xA;  most appropriate scale for an activity, blasts notions that &quot;growth is&#xA;  good,&quot; and that &quot;bigger is better,&quot; and questions the appropriateness&#xA;  of using mass production in developing countries, promoting instead&#xA;  &quot;production by the masses.&quot; Schumacher was one of the first economists&#xA;  to question the appropriateness of using gross national product to&#xA;  measure human well-being, emphasizing that &quot;the aim ought to be to&#xA;  obtain the maximum amount of well being with the minimum amount of&#xA;  consumption.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As noted in the above article, it's also interesting to note that EF Schumacher was academically linked to John Kenneth Galbraith, who posited the proposal in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Capitalism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Capitalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that an economy can exist in a steady state equilibrium (as EnergyNumbers alludes to). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question of whether or not interest is sustainable is covered pretty well in Joseph Schumpeter's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism,_Socialism_and_Democracy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (short answer- according to him- &quot;no&quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book that most directly answers your question is &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; the most contentious and least academic of the books listed here: Clyde Prestowitz's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0048ELCUQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Betrayal of American Prosperity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however it should be noted that the author is heavily credentialed and the book is rated a full 5 stars (from 20 reviewers) on Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="975" LastEditorUserId="975" LastEditDate="2014-01-17T12:52:40.200" LastActivityDate="2014-01-17T12:52:40.200" />
