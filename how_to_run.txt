# how to run the code

1. file="sustainibility data cleaning"
  generate postsXMLDF, usersXMLDF

2. file="sql"
  generate acceptedUsers, 
  then find this line
  # separating the answered questions into testing and training (80/20)

  run the code to create trainacceptedUsers, testacceptedUsers, collapsedUsers, 
  ownerTagCountHash (run the for loop)

3. file="tag clusters"
  create variables upto t1
  create variables pairs and graph

4. file="validation"
  find this line
  # using the clustered tags to expand the tags for the question
  run whatever commiunity algorithm (walktrap, infomap) on the graph object
  create hashByTag, hashByClusterNumber by running the for loop below

  also register the function "expandTags"

5. file="weight_model"
  run this file sequentially
  the first for loop will give you weights (tagScoreWt, repWt)

  the second for loop will give you "truncatingLength"

6. file="validation"
  find this line
  # TESTING: requires the following objects to exist

  run code upto
  # accuracy, not sure if this a good measure
  below code line gives accuracy for ranked expanded cluster tags
  table(testResultsDF$FOUND.Ranked)["TRUE"] / nrow(testResultsDF)
